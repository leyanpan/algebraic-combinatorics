## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signTupleToSubset (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{d : ℕ} → (Fin d → ZMod 2) → Finset (Fin d)

Body:
fun {d} e => {k | e k = 1}

Docstring: Bijection between sign tuples and subsets of `[d]`:
A sign tuple `(e_1, ..., e_d) ∈ {1,-1}^d` corresponds to the set
`{i ∈ [d] | e_i = -1}` of positions with -1. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF ZMod
ℕ → Type

Docstring: The integers modulo `n : ℕ`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ZMod.decidableEq
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (ZMod n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`.

(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Sign tuple to subset

\leanhelper  The map $\operatorname {signTupleToSubset} : (\operatorname {Fin} d \to \mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z}) \to \mathcal{P}(\operatorname {Fin} d)$ sends a sign tuple $e$ to the set $S = \{ k \in \operatorname {Fin} d \mid e_k = 1\} $ (i.e., the positions where $\operatorname {toSign}(e_k) = -1$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.cancel.tosign
Sign conversion

\leanhelper  The function $\operatorname {toSign} : \mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}$ converts elements of $\mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z}$ to signs: $\operatorname {toSign}(0) = 1$ and $\operatorname {toSign}(1) = -1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target has exactly the blueprint\u2019s domain and indexing: `{d : \u2115} \u2192 (Fin d \u2192 ZMod 2) \u2192 Finset (Fin d)`. Its body `fun {d} e => {k | e k = 1}` returns precisely the positions specified by the informal statement, `S = { k \u2208 Fin d | e_k = 1 }`. Using `Finset (Fin d)` is the finite-set encoding of `\ud835\udcab(Fin d)`, since `Fin d` is finite. The parenthetical interpretation also agrees with the informal definition: `toSign(1) = -1`. There are no added hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
