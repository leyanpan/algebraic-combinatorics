Docstring: The sign decomposition formula is preserved under left co-shifts.

This combines:
1. leftCoShift_preserves_combined_sign: (-1)^(sum P + sum Q) * sign(σ) is preserved
2. extractAlpha_leftCoShift_eq: sign(extractAlpha) is preserved
3. extractBeta_leftCoShift_eq: sign(extractBeta) is preserved

Together, these show that if the formula holds for (P, Q', σ'), it holds for (P, Q, σ).

Docstring: The image of a finset under a permutation.

This is definitionally equal to `PermFinset.imageFinset` (see `imageFinset_eq_permFinset`).
New code should prefer `PermFinset.imageFinset`.

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.finsetSumFin (def)
{n : ℕ} → Finset (Fin n) → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} P => ∑ i ∈ P, ↑i

Docstring: Sum of elements in a finset of Fin n, viewed as natural numbers.
Used in the sign factor of the det(A+B) formula.

Note: This is named `finsetSumFin` to distinguish from `AlgebraicCombinatorics.QBinomialRec.finsetSumNat`,
which computes the sum of elements in a `Finset ℕ` directly.
Both compute "the sum of elements" but for different element types.

Docstring: Extract α from σ: For σ with σ(P) = Q, extract the permutation α ∈ Perm(Fin |P|)
that describes how σ permutes the elements of P.

Specifically, if p₁ < p₂ < ... < pₖ are the elements of P and 
q₁ < q₂ < ... < qₖ are the elements of Q, then α is defined by
σ(pᵢ) = q_{α(i)}.

Body:
fun {R} {n m} A U V => A.submatrix ⇑(U.orderEmbOfFin ⋯) ⇑(V.orderEmbOfFin ⋯)

Docstring: The submatrix of A obtained by restricting to rows in U and columns in V.
This corresponds to `sub_U^V A` in the source (Definition def.det.sub).
Label: def.det.sub

## Mathematical Description

Let A be an n×m matrix. Let U ⊆ [n] and V ⊆ [m] be subsets.
Writing U = {u₁, u₂, ..., uₚ} with u₁ < u₂ < ... < uₚ
and V = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₚ} with v₁ < v₂ < ... < vₚ,
we define sub_U^V A := (A_{uᵢ,vⱼ})_{1≤i≤p, 1≤j≤q}.

This is the |U|×|V| matrix obtained from A by keeping only the rows
indexed by U and columns indexed by V, in increasing order.

## Terminology

- **Submatrix**: The matrix sub_U^V A
- **Minor**: When |U| = |V|, the determinant det(sub_U^V A) is called a minor of A
- **Principal minor**: When U = V, the minor det(sub_U^U A) is called a principal minor

## Implementation

In Mathlib, `Matrix.submatrix` takes functions for row and column selection.
For finite sets, we use the canonical order-preserving embedding `orderEmbOfFin`.

Docstring: For σ with σ(P) = Q, the image of any element of P under σ lies in Q.

Docstring: Helper: Given P, Q with same cardinality, compute the determinant of the
submatrix of A restricted to rows P and columns Q.

  AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.imageFinset σ P = Q → ∀ (i : Fin Pᶜ.card), σ ((Pᶜ.orderEmbOfFin ⋯) i) ∈ Qᶜ

Docstring: For σ with σ(P) = Q, the image of any element of Pᶜ under σ lies in Qᶜ. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.swap
{α : Sort u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → α → α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: `swap a b` is the permutation that swaps `a` and `b` and
leaves other values as is. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHMul
{α : Type u_1} → [Mul α] → HMul α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instMul
{α : Type u_4} → Mul (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq.mpr
{α β : Sort u} → α = β → β → α

Docstring: If `h : α = β` is a proof of type equality, then `h.mpr : β → α` is the induced
"cast" operation in the reverse direction, mapping elements of `β` to elements of `α`.

You can prove theorems about the resulting element by induction on `h`, since
`rfl.mpr` is definitionally the identity function.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF id
{α : Sort u} → α → α

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF congrArg
∀ {α : Sort u} {β : Sort v} {a₁ a₂ : α} (f : α → β), a₁ = a₂ → f a₁ = f a₂

Docstring: Congruence in the function argument: if `a₁ = a₂` then `f a₁ = f a₂` for
any (nondependent) function `f`. This is more powerful than it might look at first, because
you can also use a lambda expression for `f` to prove that
`<something containing a₁> = <something containing a₂>`. This function is used
internally by tactics like `congr` and `simp` to apply equalities inside
subterms.

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Units.val
{α : Type u} → [inst : Monoid α] → αˣ → α

Docstring: The underlying value in the base `Monoid`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instMonoid

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MonoidHom
(M : Type u_10) → (N : Type u_11) → [MulOne M] → [MulOne N] → Type (max u_10 u_11)

Docstring: `M →* N` is the type of functions `M → N` that preserve the `MulOne` structure.
`MonoidHom` is used for both monoid and group homomorphisms.

When possible, instead of parametrizing results over `(f : M →* N)`,
you should parametrize over `(F : Type*) [MonoidHomClass F M N] (f : F)`.

When you extend this structure, make sure to extend `MonoidHomClass`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Units
(α : Type u) → [Monoid α] → Type u

Docstring: Units of a `Monoid`, bundled version. Notation: `αˣ`.

An element of a `Monoid` is a unit if it has a two-sided inverse.

For a predicate see `IsUnit`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α ↪ β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.orderEmbOfFin

Docstring: Given a finset `s` of cardinality `k` in a linear order `α`, the map `orderEmbOfFin s h` is
the increasing bijection between `Fin k` and `s` as an order embedding into `α`. Here, `h` is a
proof that the cardinality of `s` is `k`. We use this instead of an embedding `Fin s.card ↪o α` to
avoid casting issues in further uses of this function.

This definition is an abbreviation of `RelIso (≤) (≤)`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

{α : Type u_1} → [inst : LinearOrder α] → (s : Finset α) → {k : ℕ} → s.card = k → Fin k ≃o ↥s

Docstring: Given a finset `s` of cardinality `k` in a linear order `α`, the map `orderIsoOfFin s h`
is the increasing bijection between `Fin k` and `s` as an `OrderIso`. Here, `h` is a proof that
the cardinality of `s` is `k`. We use this instead of an iso `Fin s.card ≃o s` to avoid
casting issues in further uses of this function.

Docstring: A function `f : α → β` is called injective if `f x = f y` implies `x = y`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Surjective

for some `a : α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix

Docstring: `Matrix m n R` is the type of matrices with entries in `R`, whose rows are indexed by `m`
and whose columns are indexed by `n`.

  {m : Type u_2} → {n : Type u_3} → {o : Type u_4} → {α : Type v} → Matrix m n α → (l → m) → (o → n) → Matrix l o α

Docstring: Given maps `(r : l → m)` and `(c : o → n)` reindexing the rows and columns of
a matrix `M : Matrix m n α`, the matrix `M.submatrix r c : Matrix l o α` is defined
by `(M.submatrix r c) i j = M (r i) (c j)` for `(i,j) : l × o`.
Note that the total number of row and columns does not have to be preserved. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF rfl
∀ {α : Sort u} {a : α}, a = a

Docstring: `rfl : a = a` is the unique constructor of the equality type. This is the
same as `Eq.refl` except that it takes `a` implicitly instead of explicitly.

This is a more powerful theorem than it may appear at first, because although
the statement of the theorem is `a = a`, Lean will allow anything that is
definitionally equal to that type. So, for instance, `2 + 2 = 4` is proven in
Lean by `rfl`, because both sides are the same up to definitional equality.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Left co-shift invariance

\leanhelper  If the sign decomposition formula holds for $(P, Q', \sigma ')$ (where $Q' = s_i(Q)$, $\sigma ' = s_i\cdot \sigma $ for $i\notin Q$, $i{+}1\in Q$), then it holds for $(P, Q, \sigma )$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.setq
def.perm.setQ

\leanhelper  The set $Q$ from Proposition~ \ref{prop.perm.lisitij}: $Q = \{ k \in \{ i+1, \ldots , j-1\}  \mid \sigma (j) < \sigma (k) < \sigma (i)\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sign
def.perm.sign

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. The \emph{sign} of a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is defined to be the integer $(-1)^{\ell (\sigma )}$. 

It is denoted by $(-1)^{\sigma }$ or $\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )$ or $\operatorname {sign}(\sigma )$ or $\varepsilon (\sigma )$. It is also known as the \emph{signature} of $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.monomial
def.sf.monomial

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{monomial} is an expression of the form $x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ with $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N \in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{degree} $\deg \mathfrak {m}$ of a monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is defined to be $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_N \in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} A monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is said to be \emph{squarefree} if $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N \in \{ 0,1\} $. (This is saying that no square or higher power of an indeterminate appears in $\mathfrak {m}$; thus the name “squarefree”.) \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} A monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is said to be \emph{primal} if there is at most one $i \in [N]$ satisfying $a_i > 0$. (This is saying that the monomial $\mathfrak {m}$ contains no two distinct indeterminates. Thus, a primal monomial is just $1$ or a power of an indeterminate.)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.schur
def.sf.schur

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. We define the \emph{Schur polynomial} $s_{\lambda }\in \mathcal{P}$ by

\[  s_{\lambda }:=\sum _{T\in \operatorname *{SSYT}\left( \lambda \right) }x_{T}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ytab.xt
def.sf.ytab.xT

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. If $T$ is any Young tableau of shape $\lambda $, then we define the corresponding monomial

\[  x_{T}:=\prod _{c\text{ is a box of }Y\left( \lambda \right) }x_{T\left( c\right) }=\prod _{\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) }x_{T\left( i,j\right) }=\prod _{k=1}^{N}x_{k}^{\left( \text{\#  of times }k\text{ appears in }T\right) }.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.switch
def.switch

\leanhelper  For $i \in \mathbb {N}$, define the \emph{switch operation} $\operatorname {switch}_i$ on finite subsets $S$ of $\mathbb {N}$ by 

\[  \operatorname {switch}_i(S) := \begin{cases}  S \bigtriangleup \{ i, i+1\} , &  \text{if } |S \cap \{ i, i+1\} | = 1; \\ S, &  \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}  \]

 In other words, if exactly one of $i$ and $i+1$ belongs to $S$, then we replace it by the other; otherwise we leave $S$ unchanged.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unclear",
  "justification": "The co-shift structure matches: the formal statement assumes `hi_notQ : i \u2209 Q` and `hiplus_Q : \u27e8\u2191i + 1, hi\u27e9 \u2208 Q`, then sets `s := Equiv.swap i \u27e8\u2191i + 1, hi\u27e9`, `Q' := imageFinset s Q`, and `\u03c3' := s * \u03c3`, corresponding to \u201c$Q'=s_i(Q)$, $\\sigma'=s_i\\cdot\\sigma$ for $i\\notin Q$, $i+1\\in Q$.\u201d However, the blueprint never states or defines the \u201csign decomposition formula.\u201d Therefore it is impossible to verify that the displayed formal equality involving `finsetSumFin`, `extractAlpha`, and `extractBeta` is that formula. It is also impossible to tell whether the additional binders `hcard : P.card = Q.card` and `h\u03c3 : imageFinset \u03c3 P = Q` are implicit domain conditions of the intended formula or contentful added hypotheses. The package would need the blueprint definition or explicit equation for the sign decomposition formula, including its admissibility conditions on `(P,Q,\u03c3)`, to decide faithfulness."
