## TARGET Equiv.Perm.length_mul_mod_two (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), (σ * τ).length % 2 = (σ.length + τ.length) % 2

Docstring: **Corollary cor.perm.red.sigtau (a)**: The length of a product has the same
parity as the sum of lengths: ℓ(στ) ≡ ℓ(σ) + ℓ(τ) (mod 2).

This follows from the fact that multiplying by a simple transposition
always changes the length by exactly 1 (either +1 or -1). 

## TARGET Equiv.Perm.word_length_ge_and_parity (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (w : Equiv.Perm.Word n),
  List.length w ≥ (Equiv.Perm.wordProd w).length ∧ List.length w % 2 = (Equiv.Perm.wordProd w).length % 2

Docstring: **Corollary cor.perm.red.sigtau (c)**: For any word representing σ,
the word length is at least ℓ(σ) and has the same parity as ℓ(σ). 

## TARGET Equiv.Perm.length_mul_le (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), (σ * τ).length ≤ σ.length + τ.length

Docstring: **Corollary cor.perm.red.sigtau (b)**: The length of a product is at most
the sum of lengths: ℓ(στ) ≤ ℓ(σ) + ℓ(τ).

This is the triangle inequality for the length function. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.length (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} σ => σ.inversions.card

Docstring: The length of a permutation is the number of its inversions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.Word (def)
ℕ → Type

Body:
fun n => List (Fin (n - 1))

Docstring: A word is a list of indices representing simple transpositions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.wordProd (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm.Word n → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} w => (List.map Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition w).prod

Docstring: The product of simple transpositions corresponding to a word. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.inversions (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n × Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ => {p | p.1 < p.2 ∧ σ p.2 < σ p.1}

Docstring: The set of inversions of a permutation. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition (def)
{n : ℕ} → Fin (n - 1) → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} k => if h : n > 0 then Equiv.swap (Fin.castLE ⋯ k.castSucc) (Fin.castLE ⋯ k.succ) else 1

Docstring: The simple transposition `s_k` that swaps `k` and `k+1` in `Fin n`.
For `k : Fin (n-1)`, this swaps positions `k.castSucc` and `k.succ`.

**Note:** This is equivalent to `AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition k` from `Basics.lean`.
See `simpleTransposition_eq_canonical` for the proof of equivalence.

**Recommended:** For new code, prefer `AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition` (the canonical
definition). Use this definition when working with reduced words and Coxeter-style arguments
within this file. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMod.hMod
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMod α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a % b` computes the remainder upon dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For `Nat` and `Int` it satisfies `a % b + b * (a / b) = a`,
  and `a % 0` is defined to be `a`.

{α : Type u_4} → Mul (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.prod
{α : Type u_1} → [Mul α] → [One α] → List α → α

Docstring: Computes the product of the elements of a list.

Examples:

[a, b, c].prod = a * (b * (c * 1))
[2, 3, 5].prod = 30


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instOne
{α : Type u_4} → One (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α → β) → List α → List β

Docstring: Applies a function to each element of the list, returning the resulting list of values.

`O(|l|)`.

Examples:
* `[a, b, c].map f = [f a, f b, f c]`
* `[].map Nat.succ = []`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.length) = [3, 3, 5]`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.reverse) = ["eno", "owt", "eerht"]`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instFintypeProd
(α : Type u_4) → (β : Type u_5) → [Fintype α] → [Fintype β] → Fintype (α × β)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 5 < 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.swap
{α : Sort u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → α → α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: `swap a b` is the permutation that swaps `a` and `b` and
leaves other values as is. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.castLE
{n m : ℕ} → n ≤ m → Fin n → Fin m

Docstring: Coarsens a bound to one at least as large.

See also `Fin.castAdd` for a version that represents the larger bound with addition rather than an
explicit inequality proof.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.castSucc
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → Fin (n + 1)

Docstring: Coarsens a bound by one.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.succ
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → Fin (n + 1)

Docstring: The successor, with an increased bound.

This differs from adding `1`, which instead wraps around.

Examples:
* `(2 : Fin 3).succ = (3 : Fin 4)`
* `(2 : Fin 3) + 1 = (0 : Fin 3)`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} We have $\ell (\sigma \tau ) \equiv \ell (\sigma ) + \ell (\tau ) \pmod{2}$ for all $\sigma , \tau \in S_n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} We have $\ell (\sigma \tau ) \leq \ell (\sigma ) + \ell (\tau )$ for all $\sigma , \tau \in S_n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $k_1, k_2, \ldots , k_q \in [n-1]$, and let $\sigma = s_{k_1} s_{k_2} \cdots s_{k_q}$. Then $q \geq \ell (\sigma )$ and $q \equiv \ell (\sigma ) \pmod{2}$.

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unclear",
  "justification": "The numerical content aligns: the targets quantify `\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` and state respectively `(\u03c3 * \u03c4).length % 2 = (\u03c3.length + \u03c4.length) % 2`, `(\u03c3 * \u03c4).length \u2264 \u03c3.length + \u03c4.length`, and for every `w : Equiv.Perm.Word n`, `List.length w \u2265 (Equiv.Perm.wordProd w).length` with equal parity. Also, `length` is exactly inversion cardinality, while `Word n = List (Fin (n - 1))` and `simpleTransposition` implement the harmless zero-based versions of `[n-1]` and `s_i`.\n\nHowever, the blueprint explicitly fixes multiplication by saying `\u03b1\u03b2` is `\u03b1 \u2218 \u03b2`, sending `x` to `\u03b1 (\u03b2 x)`. The formal statements use `\u03c3 * \u03c4`, and `wordProd` uses `(List.map Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition w).prod`, but the package supplies only the binder `Equiv.Perm.instMul : Mul (Equiv.Perm \u03b1)` and no body or docstring identifying its multiplication with that composition convention. Indeed, the supplied `HMul.hMul` docstring says its meaning is type-dependent. The identity used by `List.prod` is likewise represented only by `Equiv.Perm.instOne` without its semantics. Thus the package does not determine whether `(\u03c3 * \u03c4)` and `wordProd w` denote the products occurring in parts (a)\u2013(c). To establish faithfulness, it would need the body or a defining equation for `Equiv.Perm.instMul`\u2014for example `(\u03c3 * \u03c4) x = \u03c3 (\u03c4 x)`\u2014and the corresponding identity equation for `Equiv.Perm.instOne`."
