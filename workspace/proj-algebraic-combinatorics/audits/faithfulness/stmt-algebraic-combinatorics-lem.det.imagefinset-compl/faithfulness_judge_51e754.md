## TARGET PermFinset.imageFinset_compl (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (P : Finset (Fin n)), PermFinset.imageFinset σ Pᶜ = (PermFinset.imageFinset σ P)ᶜ

Docstring: The image of a complement equals the complement of the image. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PermFinset.imageFinset (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ P => Finset.map { toFun := ⇑σ, inj' := ⋯ } P

Docstring: The image of a finset under a permutation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α ↪ β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.det.imageFinset-compl

\leanhelper  The image of a complement equals the complement of the image: $\sigma (P^c) = \sigma (P)^c$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.det.sum-compl
conv.det.sum-compl

For any subset $I$ of $[n]$, we write $\widetilde{I} = [n] \setminus I$ for its complement, and $\operatorname {sum} S = \sum _{s \in S} s$ for any finite set $S$ of integers.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.imagefinset
def.det.imageFinset

\leanhelper  The \emph{image} of a finite subset $P \subseteq [n]$ under a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is $\sigma (P) = \{ \sigma (i) \mid i \in P\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.finsetsumfin
Subset sum and permutation sets

\leanhelper  For a subset $P\subseteq [n]$, define $\operatorname {sum}(P) = \sum _{i\in P} i$. 

For subsets $P,Q\subseteq [n]$, define $\operatorname {Perm}(P,Q) = \{ \sigma \in S_n : \sigma (P)=Q\} $ where $\sigma (P) = \{ \sigma (i) \mid i \in P\} $ denotes the image of $P$ under $\sigma $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint states, for a permutation \u03c3 and subset P of [n], \u201cThe image of a complement equals the complement of the image: \u03c3(P^c) = \u03c3(P)^c.\u201d The target quantifies exactly `\u2200 {n : \u2115} (\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (P : Finset (Fin n))` and concludes `PermFinset.imageFinset \u03c3 P\u1d9c = (PermFinset.imageFinset \u03c3 P)\u1d9c`. Here `Fin n` represents `[n]`, `Finset (Fin n)` represents its subsets, and `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` represents permutations. The dependency defines `imageFinset` as `Finset.map ... P`, matching the informal image `{\u03c3(i) | i \u2208 P}`. The complements are supplied by `Finset.booleanAlgebra` using the finite universe `Fin n`, so they mean `[n] \\ P` as fixed by the informal definition. There are no added hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
