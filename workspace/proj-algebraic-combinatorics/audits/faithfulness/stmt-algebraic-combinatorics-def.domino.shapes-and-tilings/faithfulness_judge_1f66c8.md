## TARGET DominoTilingsZ.Domino (inductive) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
Type

Body:
DominoTilingsZ.Domino.horizontal : ℤ → ℤ → DominoTilingsZ.Domino
DominoTilingsZ.Domino.vertical : ℤ → ℤ → DominoTilingsZ.Domino

Docstring: A domino is either horizontal or vertical (Definition \ref{def.domino.shapes-and-tilings}(c)) 

## TARGET DominoTilingsZ.Tiling (inductive) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
DominoTilingsZ.Shape → Type

Body:
DominoTilingsZ.Tiling.mk : {S : DominoTilingsZ.Shape} →
  (dominos : Set DominoTilingsZ.Domino) →
    dominos.PairwiseDisjoint DominoTilingsZ.Domino.toShape → ⋃ d ∈ dominos, d.toShape = S → DominoTilingsZ.Tiling S

Docstring: A domino tiling of a shape S is a set partition of S into dominos
(Definition \ref{def.domino.shapes-and-tilings}(d)) 

## TARGET DominoTilingsZ.Rectangle (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
ℕ → ℕ → DominoTilingsZ.Shape

Body:
fun n m => {p | 1 ≤ p.1 ∧ p.1 ≤ ↑n ∧ 1 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.2 ≤ ↑m}

Docstring: The n × m rectangle (Definition \ref{def.domino.shapes-and-tilings}(b)) 

## TARGET DominoTilingsZ.numTilings (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun n m => Nat.card (DominoTilingsZ.Tiling (DominoTilingsZ.Rectangle n m))

Docstring: The number of domino tilings of the n × m rectangle
(Definition \ref{def.domino.shapes-and-tilings}(e))

This is defined as the cardinality of the type of all tilings.
Note: For this to be meaningful, the set of tilings must be finite,
which holds for any finite rectangle. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY DominoTilingsZ.Domino.toShape (def)
DominoTilingsZ.Domino → DominoTilingsZ.Shape

Body:
fun x =>
  match x with
  | DominoTilingsZ.Domino.horizontal i j => {(i, j), (i + 1, j)}
  | DominoTilingsZ.Domino.vertical i j => {(i, j), (i, j + 1)}

Docstring: The cells covered by a domino 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.PairwiseDisjoint
{α : Type u_1} → {ι : Type u_4} → [inst : PartialOrder α] → [OrderBot α] → Set ι → (ι → α) → Prop

Docstring: A set is `PairwiseDisjoint` under `f`, if the images of any distinct two elements under `f`
are disjoint.

`s.Pairwise Disjoint` is (definitionally) the same as `s.PairwiseDisjoint id`. We prefer the latter
in order to allow dot notation on `Set.PairwiseDisjoint`, even though the former unfolds more
nicely.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CompleteBooleanAlgebra.toCompleteDistribLattice
{α : Type u} → [CompleteBooleanAlgebra α] → CompleteDistribLattice α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.card

Docstring: `Nat.card α` is the cardinality of `α` as a natural number.
If `α` is infinite, `Nat.card α = 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Insert.insert
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Insert α γ] → α → γ → γ

Docstring: `insert x xs` inserts the element `x` into the collection `xs`.

{α : Type u} → Insert α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Singleton.singleton
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {β : Type v} → [self : Singleton α β] → α → β

Docstring: `singleton x` is a collection with the single element `x` (notation: `{x}`). 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{x}` in identifiers is `singleton`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.domino.shapes-and-tilings

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{shape} means a subset of $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$. 

We draw each $\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}$ as a unit square with center at the point $\left( i,j\right) $ (in Cartesian coordinates); thus, a shape can be drawn as a cluster of squares. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} For any $n,m\in \mathbb {N}$, the shape $R_{n,m}$ (called the $n\times m$\emph{-rectangle}) is defined to be

\[  \left\{  1,2,\ldots ,n\right\}  \times \left\{  1,2,\ldots ,m\right\}  =\left\{  \left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}\  \mid \  1\leq i\leq n\text{ and }1\leq j\leq m\right\}  .  \]

\textbf{(c)} A \emph{domino} means a size-$2$ shape of the form

\begin{align*} &  \left\{  \left( i,j\right) ,\  \left( i+1,j\right) \right\}  \text{ (a ``\emph{horizontal domino}'')}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{or}\\ &  \left\{  \left( i,j\right) ,\  \left( i,j+1\right) \right\}  \text{ (a ``\emph{vertical domino}'')}\end{align*}

 for some $\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} A \emph{domino tiling} of a shape $S$ is a set partition of $S$ into dominos (i.e., a set of disjoint dominos whose union is $S$). \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For any $n,m\in \mathbb {N}$, let $d_{n,m}$ be the \#  of domino tilings of $R_{n,m}$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The declarations match all five clauses. `Shape` is exactly `Set (\u2124 \u00d7 \u2124)`, matching \u201ca subset of \u2124\u00b2.\u201d `Rectangle n m` is `{p | 1 \u2264 p.1 \u2227 p.1 \u2264 \u2191n \u2227 1 \u2264 p.2 \u2227 p.2 \u2264 \u2191m}`, exactly the stated integer-coordinate rectangle for `n,m \u2208 \u2115`. `Domino` has precisely the horizontal and vertical constructors indexed by `i j : \u2124`, and `Domino.toShape` sends them to `{(i,j),(i+1,j)}` and `{(i,j),(i,j+1)}` respectively. `Tiling.mk` requires `(dominos : Set Domino)`, `dominos.PairwiseDisjoint Domino.toShape`, and `\u22c3 d \u2208 dominos, d.toShape = S`, which expresses a set of pairwise disjoint dominos whose union is `S`. Finally, `numTilings n m := Nat.card (Tiling (Rectangle n m))` is the cardinality of the type of such tilings, matching the number `d_{n,m}`. Although `Nat.card` returns `0` on infinite types, rectangle tilings are finite here, so this does not alter the intended meaning."
