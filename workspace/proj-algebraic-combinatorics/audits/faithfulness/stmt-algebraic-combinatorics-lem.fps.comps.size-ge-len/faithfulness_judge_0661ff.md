## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition.size_ge_len (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (α : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition), α.len ≤ α.size

Docstring: The size of a composition is at least its length, since each part is positive. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition (def)
Type

Body:
List ℕ+

Docstring: An integer composition is a finite tuple of positive integers.
We represent it as a list of positive integers.

(Definition def.fps.comps, part (a))


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition.len (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition → ℕ

Body:
fun α => List.length α

Docstring: The length of a composition is the number of parts.
(We use `len` to avoid conflict with `List.length`.)

(Definition def.fps.comps, part (c))


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition.size (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition → ℕ

Body:
fun α => (List.map (fun x => ↑x) α).sum

Docstring: The size of a composition is the sum of its entries.

(Definition def.fps.comps, part (b))


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PNat
Type

Docstring: `ℕ+` is the type of positive natural numbers. It is defined as a subtype,
and the VM representation of `ℕ+` is the same as `ℕ` because the proof
is not stored. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.sum
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → [Zero α] → List α → α

Docstring: Computes the sum of the elements of a list.

Examples:
* `[a, b, c].sum = a + (b + (c + 0))`
* `[1, 2, 5].sum = 8`

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α → β) → List α → List β

Docstring: Applies a function to each element of the list, returning the resulting list of values.

`O(|l|)`.

Examples:
* `[a, b, c].map f = [f a, f b, f c]`
* `[].map Nat.succ = []`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.length) = [3, 3, 5]`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.reverse) = ["eno", "owt", "eerht"]`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PNat.val
ℕ+ → ℕ

Docstring: The underlying natural number 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.comps.size-ge-len

\leanhelper  The size of a composition is at least its length: $\ell (\alpha ) \leq |\alpha |$, since each part is a positive integer (at least $1$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies over every composition, `\u2200 (\u03b1 : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition), \u03b1.len \u2264 \u03b1.size`, exactly matching the blueprint claim `\u2113(\u03b1) \u2264 |\u03b1|`. The dependency bodies preserve the informal meanings: `Composition` is `List \u2115+`, matching a finite tuple of positive integers; `len` is `List.length \u03b1`, matching the number of parts; and `size` is `(List.map (fun x => \u2191x) \u03b1).sum`, matching the sum of the parts. There are no added hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
