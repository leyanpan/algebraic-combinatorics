## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiLHSEval (def)
ℤ → ℤ → ℚ → ℚ → PowerSeries ℚ

Body:
fun a b u v =>
  ∏' (k : ℕ),
    have n := k + 1;
    have exp1 := ((2 * ↑n - 1) * a + b).toNat;
    have exp2 := ((2 * ↑n - 1) * a - b).toNat;
    have exp3 := (2 * ↑n * a).toNat;
    have coeff1 := u ^ (2 * n - 1) * v;
    have coeff2 := u ^ (2 * n - 1) * v⁻¹;
    have coeff3 := u ^ (2 * n);
    (1 + coeff1 • PowerSeries.X ^ exp1) * (1 + coeff2 • PowerSeries.X ^ exp2) * (1 - coeff3 • PowerSeries.X ^ exp3)

Docstring: The left-hand side of Jacobi's triple product identity evaluated at q = u·x^a, z = v·x^b:
  ∏_{n>0} ((1 + q^{2n-1}z)(1 + q^{2n-1}z^{-1})(1 - q^{2n}))

Expanding with q = u·x^a and z = v·x^b:
  ∏_{n>0} ((1 + u^{2n-1}v·x^{(2n-1)a+b})(1 + u^{2n-1}v^{-1}·x^{(2n-1)a-b})(1 - u^{2n}·x^{2na}))

When a > 0 and a ≥ |b|, all exponents (2n-1)a+b, (2n-1)a-b, and 2na are nonnegative
for n > 0, so this is a well-defined element of ℚ⟦X⟧.
The infinite product is multipliable because the exponents grow linearly in n.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.eulerProduct (def)
{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → PowerSeries R

Body:
fun {R} [CommRing R] => ∏' (k : ℕ), (1 - PowerSeries.X ^ (k + 1))

Docstring: The Euler product ∏_{k≥1} (1 - x^k).

This is defined using the discrete topology on R, which ensures the infinite product
is well-defined via Mathlib's infrastructure for infinite products of power series.
The product is multipliable because the order of (1 - X^k) is k, which tends to infinity. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Rat
Type

Docstring: Rational numbers, implemented as a pair of integers `num / den` such that the
denominator is positive and the numerator and denominator are coprime.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Neg.neg
{α : Type u} → [self : Neg α] → α → α

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

Docstring: Substitution of power series into a power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Rat.commRing
CommRing ℚ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Algebra.id

Docstring: The identity map inducing an `Algebra` structure.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HPow.hPow
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HPow α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a ^ b` computes `a` to the power of `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `^` in identifiers is `pow`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

  {β : Type u_5} →
    [CommMonoid α] → [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Docstring: `∏' i, f i` is the unconditional product of `f`, if it exists, or 1 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∏'[L] i, f i` is the product of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `1` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional product exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the multiplicative support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice,
to use the product over the multiplicative support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a`
satisfying `HasProd f a`. Similar remarks apply to more general summation filters.)

Docstring: Topologies on `α` form a complete lattice, with `⊥` the discrete topology
and `⊤` the indiscrete topology. The infimum of a collection of topologies
is the topology generated by all their open sets, while the supremum is the
topology whose open sets are those sets open in every member of the collection.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.jtp.jacobiLHS-eq-eulerProduct-sq

\leanhelper  The LHS of Jacobi’s identity evaluated at $a=3$, $b=1$, $u=1$, $v=-1$ equals $\prod _{k>0}(1-x^{k})[x^{2}]$, i.e.\  the Euler product with $x$ replaced by $x^{2}$: 

\[  \prod _{n>0}\left((1+q^{2n-1}z)(1+q^{2n-1}z^{-1})(1-q^{2n})\right)\Big|_{q=x^3,\, z=-x} = \left(\prod _{k>0}(1-x^{k})\right)\! \big[x^{2}\big].  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.ismultipliable
def.fps.lim.isMultipliable

\leanhelper  A family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ of FPSs is \emph{multipliable} if (1) $[x^0]f_i = 1$ for all $i$, and (2) for each $n \in \mathbb {N}$, there exists $N$ such that for all $i \geq N$ and all $k \leq n$, $[x^k]f_i = \delta _{k,0}$ (i.e., eventually all $f_i$ are $\equiv 1 \pmod{x^{n+1}}$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.tprod
def.fps.lim.tprod

\leanhelper  The \emph{infinite product} of a multipliable family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ is the FPS $\prod _{n \in \mathbb {N}} f_n$ whose $n$-th coefficient equals $[x^n](\prod _{j=0}^{N} f_j)$ for any sufficiently large $N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.xneq
def.fps.xneq

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $f,g\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ be two FPSs. We write $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$ if and only if 

\[  \text{each }m\in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots ,n\right\} \text{ satisfies } \left[x^{m}\right]f=\left[x^{m}\right]g.  \]

Thus, we have defined a binary relation $\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }$ on the set $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$. We say that an FPS $f$ is $x^{n}$\emph{-equivalent} to an FPS $g$ if and only if $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pent.eulerproduct
def.pent.eulerProduct

\leanhelper  The \emph{Euler product} is the infinite product 

\[  \prod _{k=1}^{\infty }(1 - x^k) \in R[[x]],  \]

 defined as a multipliable product in the Pi topology on $R[[x]]$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target has no added binders or hypotheses and states `jacobiLHSEval 3 1 1 (-1) = PowerSeries.subst (PowerSeries.X ^ 2) eulerProduct`. By the body of `jacobiLHSEval`, these arguments implement exactly `a=3`, `b=1`, `u=1`, `v=-1`, hence `q=x^3` and `z=-x` in the informal product. The right side uses `PowerSeries.subst (PowerSeries.X ^ 2)`, exactly matching the blueprint\u2019s explicit clarification \u201cthe Euler product with `x` replaced by `x\u00b2`.\u201d Thus the bracket notation in this statement denotes substitution, not the separately defined coefficient operator. Finally, `eulerProduct` has body `\u220f' (k : \u2115), (1 - X ^ (k + 1))`, matching `\u220f_{k>0}(1-x^k)` after reindexing `k+1`."
