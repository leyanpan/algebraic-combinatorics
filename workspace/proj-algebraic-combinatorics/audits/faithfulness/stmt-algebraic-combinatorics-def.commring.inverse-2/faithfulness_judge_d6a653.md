## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.inverse_unique (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {L : Type u_2} [inst : CommRing L] {a b c : L}, a * b = 1 → a * c = 1 → b = c

Docstring: **Theorem (thm.commring.inverse-uni)**: In a commutative ring, inverses are unique.
If `a * b = 1` and `a * c = 1`, then `b = c`.
This follows from Mathlib's `left_inv_eq_right_inv`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.commring.inverse

Let $L$ be a commutative ring. Let $a\in L$. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inverse} (or \emph{multiplicative inverse}) of $a$ means an element $b\in L$ such that $ab=ba=1$. 

\textbf{(b)} We say that $a$ is \emph{invertible} in $L$ (or a \emph{unit} of $L$) if $a$ has an inverse.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## VERDICT

  "verdict": "significant_divergence",
  "discrepancies": [
    {
      "root": "the elaborated signature of `AlgebraicCombinatorics.inverse_unique`",
      "severity": "significant",
      "bridge": "There is no bridge from uniqueness of elements satisfying `a * b = 1` to the blueprint\u2019s two definitional clauses. The theorem neither characterizes an inverse as an element satisfying both `a * b = 1` and `b * a = 1`, nor defines invertibility/unit status as existence of such an inverse. Recovering those clauses would require introducing definitions absent from the formal declaration; they are not consequences supplied by this uniqueness theorem."
    }
  ],
  "justification": "The formal declaration asserts only `a * b = 1 \u2192 a * c = 1 \u2192 b = c`, i.e. uniqueness of two right inverses. The blueprint instead states definitions: \u201cAn inverse ... of `a` means an element `b\u2208L` such that `ab=ba=1`\u201d and \u201c`a` is invertible ... if `a` has an inverse.\u201d Although commutativity makes `ab = 1` imply `ba = 1`, the formal theorem still does not state either requested definition or the existential notion of invertibility."
