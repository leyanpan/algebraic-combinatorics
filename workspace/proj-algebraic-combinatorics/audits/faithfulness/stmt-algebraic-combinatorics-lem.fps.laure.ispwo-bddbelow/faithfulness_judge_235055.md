## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.DoublyInfinitePowerSeries.Int.isPWO_of_bddBelow (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {s : Set ℤ}, BddBelow s → s.IsPWO

Docstring: For ℤ, a set bounded below is partially well-ordered.

This follows from the fact that any sequence in ℤ bounded below has a monotone
subsequence (by Ramsey's theorem / infinite pigeonhole). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF BddBelow
{α : Type u_1} → [LE α] → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is bounded below if there exists a lower bound.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.IsPWO
{α : Type u_2} → [Preorder α] → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A subset of a preorder is partially well-ordered when any infinite sequence contains
a monotone subsequence of length 2 (or equivalently, an infinite monotone subsequence).

def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.module
def.alg.module

Let $K$ be a commutative ring. 

A $K$\emph{-module} means a set $M$ equipped with three maps 

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \ominus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times M\rightarrow M \end{align*}

 (notice that the third map has domain $K\times M$, not $M\times M$) and an element $\overrightarrow {0}\in M$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in M$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of scaling:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) =\left( uv\right) \rightharpoonup a$ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left distributivity:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( a\oplus b\right) =\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( u\rightharpoonup b\right) $ for all $u\in K$ and $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right distributivity:} We have $\left( u+v\right) \rightharpoonup a=\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) $ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $1\rightharpoonup a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left annihilation:} We have $0\rightharpoonup a=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right annihilation:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $u\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{scaling} (or the $K$\emph{-action}) of the $K$-module $M$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\rightharpoonup b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The element $\overrightarrow {0}$ is called the \emph{zero} (or the \emph{zero vector}) of the $K$-module $M$. We will usually just call it $0$. 

When $M$ is a $K$-module, the elements of $M$ are called \emph{vectors}, while the elements of $K$ are called \emph{scalars}. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $, with the operation $\rightharpoonup $ having higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $.

def.fps.laure.double

Let $K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $ be the $K$-module $K^{\mathbb {Z}}$ of all families $\left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}=\left( \ldots ,a_{-2},a_{-1},a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) $ of elements of $K$. Its addition and its scaling are defined entrywise:

\begin{align*}  \left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}+\left( b_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}} &  =\left( a_{n}+b_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}};\\ \lambda \left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}} &  =\left( \lambda a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }\lambda \in K. \end{align*}

 An element of $K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $ will be called a \emph{doubly infinite power series}. We use the notation $\sum _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}a_{n}x^{n}$ for a family $\left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}\in K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.laure.lauser
def.fps.laure.lauser

We let $K\left( \left( x\right) \right) $ be the subset of $K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $ consisting of all families $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {Z}}\in K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $ such that the sequence $\left( a_{-1},a_{-2},a_{-3},\ldots \right) $ is essentially finite – i.e., such that all sufficiently low $i\in \mathbb {Z}$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$. 

The elements of $K\left( \left( x\right) \right) $ are called \emph{Laurent series} in one indeterminate $x$ over $K$. 

In Mathlib, Laurent series are implemented as Hahn series over $\mathbb {Z}$ with coefficients in $K$, which are functions $\mathbb {Z} \to K$ whose support is well-founded (equivalently, bounded below). The formalization also provides a predicate on doubly infinite power series that captures this textbook definition.

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.
