## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.partner_partner (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (I : Finset ℕ), AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.partner (AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.partner I) = I

Docstring: The partner operation is an involution. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.partner (def)
Finset ℕ → Finset ℕ

Body:
fun I => symmDiff I {0}

Docstring: The partner of a finite set `I` is `I △ {0}` (symmetric difference with singleton 0).
If `0 ∈ I`, this removes 0; if `0 ∉ I`, this adds 0. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF symmDiff
{α : Type u_2} → [Max α] → [SDiff α] → α → α → α

Docstring: The symmetric difference operator on a type with `⊔` and `\` is `(A \ B) ⊔ (B \ A)`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SemilatticeSup.toMax
{α : Type u} → [SemilatticeSup α] → Max α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Lattice.toSemilatticeSup
{α : Type u} → [self : Lattice α] → SemilatticeSup α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instLattice
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → Lattice (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSDiff
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → SDiff (Finset α)

Docstring: `s \ t` is the set consisting of the elements of `s` that are not in `t`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Singleton.singleton
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {β : Type v} → [self : Singleton α β] → α → β

Docstring: `singleton x` is a collection with the single element `x` (notation: `{x}`). 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{x}` in identifiers is `singleton`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSingleton
{α : Type u_1} → Singleton α (Finset α)

Docstring: `{a} : Finset a` is the set `{a}` containing `a` and nothing else.

This differs from `insert a ∅` in that it does not require a `DecidableEq` instance for `α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.partner_partner

\leanhelper  The partner operation is an involution: $(I')' = I$ for all finite sets $I$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.partner
def.partner

\leanhelper  The \emph{partner} of a finite set $I$ of natural numbers is the symmetric difference $I' := I \bigtriangleup \{ 0\} $. If $0 \in I$, then $I' = I \setminus \{ 0\} $; if $0 \notin I$, then $I' = I \cup \{ 0\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invol
def.perm.invol

Let $X$ be a set. An \emph{involution} of $X$ means a map $f : X \to X$ that satisfies $f \circ f = \operatorname {id}$. Clearly, an involution is always a permutation, and equals its own inverse.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint states \u201c$(I')' = I$ for all finite sets $I$,\u201d where `partner` is defined for finite sets of natural numbers by $I' := I \\bigtriangleup \\{0\\}$. The formal dependency agrees exactly: `partner : Finset \u2115 \u2192 Finset \u2115` has body `fun I => symmDiff I {0}`. The target quantifies over precisely all such finite sets, `\u2200 (I : Finset \u2115)`, and concludes `partner (partner I) = I`, exactly expressing that this operation is an involution. There are no added hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
