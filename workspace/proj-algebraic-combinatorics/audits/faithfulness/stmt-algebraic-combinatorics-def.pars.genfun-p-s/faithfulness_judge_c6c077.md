## TARGET Nat.Partition.P (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
PowerSeries ℤ

Body:
Nat.Partition.genFun fun x x_1 => 1

Docstring: The partition generating function P = ∑_{n≥0} p(n) x^n, specialized to ℤ coefficients. 

## TARGET Nat.Partition.S (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
PowerSeries ℤ

Body:
PowerSeries.mk fun n => if n = 0 then 0 else ↑(Nat.Partition.divisorSum n)

Docstring: The divisor sum generating function S = ∑_{k≥1} σ(k) x^k. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.divisorSum (def)
ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun n => (ArithmeticFunction.sigma 1) n

Docstring: The sum of divisors function σ(n) = ∑_{d|n} d.
This is `ArithmeticFunction.sigma 1` in Mathlib. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.genFun
{R : Type u_1} → [CommSemiring R] → (ℕ → ℕ → R) → PowerSeries R

Docstring: Generating function associated with character $f(i, c)$ for partition functions, where $i$ is a
part of the partition, and $c$ is the count of that part in the partition. The character function is
multiplied within one `n.Partition`, and summed among all `n.Partition` for a fixed `n`. This way,
each `n` is assigned a value, which we use as the coefficients of the power series.

See the module docstring of `Combinatorics.Enumerative.Partition.GenFun` for more details. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instCommSemiring
CommSemiring ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.mk
{R : Type u_2} → (ℕ → R) → PowerSeries R

Docstring: Constructor for formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ArithmeticFunction
(R : Type u_1) → [Zero R] → Type (max 0 u_1)

Docstring: An arithmetic function is a function from `ℕ` that maps 0 to 0. In the literature, they are
often instead defined as functions from `ℕ+`. Multiplication on `ArithmeticFunctions` is by
Dirichlet convolution.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.pars.genFun-P-S

\leanhelper  The partition generating function $P := \sum _{n\ge 0} p(n) x^n \in \mathbb {Z}[[x]]$ and the divisor sum generating function $S := \sum _{k\ge 1} \sigma (k) x^k \in \mathbb {Z}[[x]]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.jtp.sigmaseries
def.jtp.sigmaSeries

\leanhelper  The \emph{sum-of-divisors generating function} is 

\[  S = \sum _{k>0} \sigma (k)\,  x^k \in \mathbb {Z}[[x]],  \]

 where $\sigma (k) = \sigma _1(k) = \sum _{d\mid k} d$ is the sum of positive divisors of~ $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.pn-pkn
def.pars.pn-pkn

\textbf{(a)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. Then, we set

\[  p_{k}\left( n\right) :=\left( \text{\#  of partitions of }n\text{ into }k\text{ parts}\right) .  \]

\textbf{(b)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, we set

\[  p\left( n\right) :=\left( \text{\#  of partitions of }n\right) .  \]

 This is called the $n$\emph{-th partition number}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint defines both series in `\u2124[[x]]`. The targets have type `PowerSeries \u2124`, which is precisely a formal power series over the integers. For `P`, the body `Nat.Partition.genFun fun x x_1 => 1` uses the documented partition generating function, whose coefficient at each `n` sums the character over all partitions of `n`; the constant character `1` therefore gives the number `p(n)`, matching `P := \u2211_{n\u22650} p(n) x^n`. For `S`, the body `PowerSeries.mk fun n => if n = 0 then 0 else \u2191(Nat.Partition.divisorSum n)` gives constant coefficient zero and coefficient `\u03c3(n)` for every positive `n`. The dependency `divisorSum n := (ArithmeticFunction.sigma 1) n`, together with the library meaning that `sigma 1` sums first powers of divisors, matches `\u03c3(k) = \u2211_{d\u2223k} d`. Thus it is exactly `S := \u2211_{k\u22651} \u03c3(k)x^k`, with coefficients cast canonically from `\u2115` to `\u2124`."
