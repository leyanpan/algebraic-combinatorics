## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Determinants.X_sub_X_isPrimitive (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {σ : Type u_2} [DecidableEq σ] (i j : σ),
  i ≠ j → ∀ (r : ℤ), (∀ (d : σ →₀ ℕ), r ∣ MvPolynomial.coeff d (MvPolynomial.X i - MvPolynomial.X j)) → IsUnit r

Docstring: The polynomial X_i - X_j is primitive (only units divide all coefficients).
This is needed for `irreducible_of_totalDegree_eq_one`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finsupp
Type u_9 → (M : Type u_10) → [Zero M] → Type (max u_10 u_9)

Docstring: `Finsupp α M`, denoted `α →₀ M`, is the type of functions `f : α → M` such that
`f x = 0` for all but finitely many `x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Dvd.dvd
{α : Type u_1} → [self : Dvd α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: Divisibility. `a ∣ b` (typed as `\|`) means that there is some `c` such that `b = a * c`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∣` in identifiers is `dvd`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDvd
Dvd ℤ

Docstring: Divisibility of integers. `a ∣ b` (typed as `\|`) says that
there is some `c` such that `b = a * c`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.coeff
{R : Type u} → {σ : Type u_1} → [inst : CommSemiring R] → (σ →₀ ℕ) → MvPolynomial σ R → R

Docstring: The coefficient of the monomial `m` in the multi-variable polynomial `p`.

CommSemiring ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring

{R : Type u} → {σ : Type u_1} → [inst : CommSemiring R] → σ → MvPolynomial σ R

Docstring: `X n` is the degree `1` monomial $X_n$. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF IsUnit
{M : Type u_1} → [Monoid M] → M → Prop

Docstring: An element `a : M` of a `Monoid` is a unit if it has a two-sided inverse.
The actual definition says that `a` is equal to some `u : Mˣ`, where
`Mˣ` is a bundled version of `IsUnit`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.det.X-sub-X-isPrimitive

\leanhelper  For distinct $i, j$, the polynomial $x_i - x_j \in \mathbb {Z}[x_1, \ldots , x_n]$ is primitive (its content is~ $1$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint says, \u201cFor distinct $i,j$, the polynomial $x_i-x_j\\in\\mathbb Z[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ is primitive (its content is $1$).\u201d The formal theorem assumes exactly distinctness via `(i j : \u03c3), i \u2260 j` and states that every integer dividing every coefficient is a unit: `\u2200 (r : \u2124), (\u2200 (d : \u03c3 \u2192\u2080 \u2115), r \u2223 coeff d (X i - X j)) \u2192 IsUnit r`, which is the stated primitive/content-one property over \u2124. Quantifying over arbitrary `\u03c3` is more general than the finite variable set of the blueprint, not a weakening. `[DecidableEq \u03c3]` is an implementation-level instance used to handle indexed variables and is not a mathematically substantive restriction for the finite blueprint setting."
