## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.catalan (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun n => (2 * n).choose n / (n + 1)

Docstring: The Catalan numbers, defined as $c_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$.

**Mathlib note**: This is equivalent to Mathlib's `catalan`, which is defined recursively.
The equivalence is proved by `catalan_eq_mathlib_catalan`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.choose
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Docstring: `choose n k` is the number of `k`-element subsets in an `n`-element set. Also known as binomial
coefficients. For the fact that this is the number of `k`-element-subsets of an `n`-element
set, see `Finset.card_powersetCard`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHMul

Mul ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.catalan.catalan

\leanhelper  The $n$-th \emph{Catalan number} is $c_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom {2n}{n}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target has type `\u2115 \u2192 \u2115` and body `fun n => (2 * n).choose n / (n + 1)`, directly matching the blueprint\u2019s \u201cThe n-th Catalan number is c_n = 1/(n+1) \u00b7 binom(2n,n).\u201d Here `Nat.choose (2*n) n` agrees with the informal binomial definition at natural arguments. Although `/` on `\u2115` rounds downward, the binomial coefficient is divisible by `n+1`, so this natural-number quotient equals the stated Catalan number; the rounding semantics do not change the value. The natural-number domain is also the standard indexing domain conveyed by \u201cn-th Catalan number,\u201d with no added hypothesis."
