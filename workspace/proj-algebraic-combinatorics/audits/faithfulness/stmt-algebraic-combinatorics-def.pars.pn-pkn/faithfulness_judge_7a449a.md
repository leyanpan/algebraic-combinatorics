## TARGET Nat.Partition.partsInCount (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
(I : Set ℕ) → [DecidablePred fun x => x ∈ I] → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun I [DecidablePred fun x => x ∈ I] n => (Nat.Partition.restricted n fun x => x ∈ I).card

Docstring: The number of partitions of `n` with all parts in a set `I`.
(Used in Theorem \ref{thm.pars.main-gf-parts-I}) 

## TARGET Nat.Partition.partsCount (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun k n => {p | p.parts.card = k}.card

Docstring: The function `p_k(n)`: the number of partitions of `n` into exactly `k` parts.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pn-pkn} (a)) 

## TARGET Nat.Partition.partitionCount (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE

## TARGET Nat.Partition.partsLeqCount (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun m n => (Nat.Partition.restricted n fun x => x ≤ m).card

Docstring: The number of partitions of `n` with all parts ≤ `m`.
(Used in Theorem \ref{thm.pars.main-gf-parts-n}) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidablePred
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: A decidable predicate.

A predicate is decidable if the corresponding proposition is `Decidable` for each possible argument.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.restricted
(n : ℕ) → (p : ℕ → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset n.Partition

Docstring: The finset of those partitions in which every part satisfies a certain condition. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.card

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.pars.pn-pkn

\textbf{(a)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. Then, we set

\[  p_{k}\left( n\right) :=\left( \text{\#  of partitions of }n\text{ into }k\text{ parts}\right) .  \]

\textbf{(b)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, we set

\[  p\left( n\right) :=\left( \text{\#  of partitions of }n\right) .  \]

 This is called the $n$\emph{-th partition number}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies over integers: \u201cLet n \u2208 \u2124 and k \u2208 \u2115\u201d in (a), and \u201cLet n \u2208 \u2124\u201d in (b). The corresponding formal declarations restrict the index to naturals: `Nat.Partition.partsCount : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115` with body `fun k n => ...`, and `Nat.Partition.partitionCount : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115` with body `fun n => ...`. Thus they do not define `p_k(n)` or `p(n)` for negative integers, even though the blueprint does; this narrowed domain is mathematically contentful drift. On nonnegative inputs, the bodies correctly count partitions with `p.parts.card = k` and all partitions, respectively. To make the declarations faithful, change the `n` binder in both definitions to `\u2124` (retaining `k : \u2115`) and define the count as zero for negative `n`, while using the existing `Nat.Partition` counts for nonnegative `n` (or introduce an integer-indexed partition type with no inhabitants at negative indices). `partsInCount` and `partsLeqCount` are auxiliary definitions not specified by this informal statement and do not repair the domain mismatch."
