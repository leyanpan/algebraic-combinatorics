## TARGET SymmetricFunctions.lgvPathEastStepYCoords_length_eq_xDisplacement (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (vertices : List (ℤ × ℤ)) (h_ne : vertices ≠ []),
  (∀ (i : ℕ) (hi : i + 1 < vertices.length), LGV.integerLattice.arc (vertices.get ⟨i, ⋯⟩) (vertices.get ⟨i + 1, hi⟩)) →
    (SymmetricFunctions.lgvPathEastStepYCoords vertices).length =
      ((vertices.getLast h_ne).1 - (vertices.head h_ne).1).toNat

Docstring: The number of east-steps equals the x-displacement.
This is a key property for the bijection. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY LGV.SimpleDigraph.arc (def)
{V : Type u_1} → LGV.SimpleDigraph V → V → V → Prop

Body:
fun V self => self.1

Docstring: The arc relation: `arc u v` means there is an arc from `u` to `v` 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY LGV.integerLattice (def)
LGV.SimpleDigraph (ℤ × ℤ)

Body:
{ arc := fun u v => v.1 = u.1 + 1 ∧ v.2 = u.2 ∨ v.1 = u.1 ∧ v.2 = u.2 + 1, arc_irrefl := LGV.integerLattice._proof_1 }

Docstring: The integer lattice digraph ℤ².

This is the same lattice as in LGV1.lean, but using `SimpleDigraph` instead of
Mathlib's `Digraph`. See `integerLattice_arc_iff` for the characterization
and `integerLattice_toDigraph_adj_iff` for the equivalence with LGV1's definition. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SymmetricFunctions.lgvPathEastStepYCoords (def)
List (ℤ × ℤ) → List ℤ

Body:
fun vertices =>
  List.brecOn vertices fun vertices f =>
    (match (motive := (vertices : List (ℤ × ℤ)) → List.below vertices → List ℤ) vertices with
      | [] => fun x => []
      | [head] => fun x => []
      | v₀ :: v₁ :: rest => fun x => if v₁.1 = v₀.1 + 1 ∧ v₁.2 = v₀.2 then v₀.2 :: x.1 else x.1)
      f

Docstring: Extract the y-coordinates of east-steps from an LGV path vertex list.
For a path from (a, 1) to (c, N), this returns the y-coordinates at which
each east-step occurs. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY LGV.SimpleDigraph (inductive)
Type u_1 → Type u_1

Body:
LGV.SimpleDigraph.mk : {V : Type u_1} → (arc : V → V → Prop) → (∀ (v : V), ¬arc v v) → LGV.SimpleDigraph V

Docstring: A simple digraph with vertex set V.
Convention conv.lgv.digraph(d): A simple digraph has arcs as pairs of distinct vertices. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY LGV.SimpleDigraph.mk (constructor)
{V : Type u_1} → (arc : V → V → Prop) → (∀ (v : V), ¬arc v v) → LGV.SimpleDigraph V

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SymmetricFunctions.extractEastStepYCoords (def)
List (ℤ × ℤ) → List ℤ

Body:
fun vertices =>
  List.brecOn vertices fun vertices f =>
    (match (motive := (vertices : List (ℤ × ℤ)) → List.below vertices → List ℤ) vertices with
      | [] => fun x => []
      | [head] => fun x => []
      | u :: v :: rest => fun x => if v.1 = u.1 + 1 then u.2 :: x.1 else x.1)
      f

Docstring: Extract y-coordinates at east-step positions from a path vertex list.
For a path from (a, 1) to (c, N), this gives the sequence of y-coordinates
where east-steps occur. The sequence is weakly increasing and has length (c - a).

This is a helper function for constructing the bijection between LGV paths and Sym. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.nil
{α : Type u} → List α

Docstring: The empty list, usually written `[]`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `[]` in identifiers is `nil`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.lt_of_succ_lt
∀ {n m : ℕ}, n.succ < m → n < m

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.toNat
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: Converts an integer into a natural number. Negative numbers are converted to `0`.

Examples:
* `(7 : Int).toNat = 7`
* `(0 : Int).toNat = 0`
* `(-7 : Int).toNat = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.getLast
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Docstring: Returns the last element of a non-empty list.

Examples:
* `["circle", "rectangle"].getLast (by decide) = "rectangle"`
* `["circle"].getLast (by decide) = "circle"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.head
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Docstring: Returns the first element of a non-empty list.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Or
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Or a b`, or `a ∨ b`, is the disjunction of propositions. There are two
constructors for `Or`, called `Or.inl : a → a ∨ b` and `Or.inr : b → a ∨ b`,
and you can use `match` or `cases` to destruct an `Or` assumption into the
two cases.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∨` in identifiers is `or`.

 * The recommended spelling of `\/` in identifiers is `or` (prefer `∨` over `\/`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.brecOn
{α : Type u} → {motive : List α → Sort u_1} → (t : List α) → ((t : List α) → List.below t → motive t) → motive t

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.below
{α : Type u} → {motive : List α → Sort u_1} → List α → Sort (max (u + 1) u_1)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.cons
{α : Type u} → α → List α → List α

Docstring: The list whose first element is `head`, where `tail` is the rest of the list.
Usually written `head :: tail`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `::` in identifiers is `cons`.

 * The recommended spelling of `[a]` in identifiers is `singleton`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd
{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDecidableEq
DecidableEq ℤ

Docstring: Decides whether two integers are equal. Usually accessed via the `DecidableEq Int` instance.

This function is overridden by the compiler with an efficient implementation. This definition is the
logical model.

Examples:
* `show (7 : Int) = (3 : Int) + (4 : Int) by decide`
* `if (6 : Int) = (3 : Int) * (2 : Int) then "yes" else "no" = "yes"`
* `(¬ (6 : Int) = (3 : Int)) = true`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.lgv-east-step-length

\leanhelper  The number of east-step $y$-coordinates extracted from an LGV path vertex list equals the $x$-displacement (final $x$ minus initial $x$). This is a key property for the bijection between LGV paths and lattice paths.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.lattice
def.lgv.lattice

We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ (so the vertices are pairs of integers) and arcs 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i+1,j\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}  \]

 and 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i,j+1\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}.  \]

 The arcs of the first form are called \emph{east-steps} or \emph{right-steps}; the arcs of the second form are called \emph{north-steps} or \emph{up-steps}. 

The vertices of this digraph will be called \emph{lattice points} or \emph{grid points} or simply \emph{points}. 

The entire digraph will be denoted by $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ and called the \emph{integer lattice} or \emph{integer grid}. 

Any path is uniquely determined by its starting point and its step sequence.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.lgv-path-to-lattice-path
def.sf.lgv-path-to-lattice-path

\leanhelper  Convert an LGV path (in the integer lattice digraph) from $(a, 1)$ to $(c, N)$ into a lattice path by extracting the $y$-coordinates at which east-steps occur and converting them to $\mathrm{Fin}\, N$ values (by subtracting $1$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binder `h_ne : vertices \u2260 []` and hypothesis `\u2200 (i : \u2115) (hi : i + 1 < vertices.length), LGV.integerLattice.arc ...` precisely encode a nonempty directed path vertex list. By the body of `LGV.integerLattice`, each consecutive step is either `(x,y) \u2192 (x+1,y)` or `(x,y) \u2192 (x,y+1)`, exactly the lattice arcs in `def.lgv.lattice`. The body of `SymmetricFunctions.lgvPathEastStepYCoords` adds one y-coordinate exactly in the first, east-step case. Thus its list length counts east-steps, and the conclusion equates that count with final x minus initial x. The use of `Int.toNat` is faithful because along such a directed lattice path the x-coordinate never decreases, so the displacement is nonnegative. The formal theorem is somewhat more general than the contextual conversion from `(a,1)` to `(c,N)`, since it applies to arbitrary endpoints, but this strengthening is faithful."
