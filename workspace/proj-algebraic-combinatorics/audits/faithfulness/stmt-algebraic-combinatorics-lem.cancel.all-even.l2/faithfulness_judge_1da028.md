## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.sum_signProduct_allEven (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n d : ℕ} (x : Fin n → Fin d),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.IsAllEven x →
    ∑ e, AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signProduct e x = 2 ^ d

Docstring: If an n-tuple is all-even, then the sum over all sign tuples
of the sign product equals 2^d (Lemma `lem.cancel.all-even.l2(b)`).

The proof: when all multiplicities are even, each `e_k^{m_k} = 1`
(since `(±1)^{even} = 1`), so every sign product equals 1, and
there are 2^d sign tuples.

Label: Lemma `lem.cancel.all-even.l2(b)` 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.sum_signProduct_not_allEven (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n d : ℕ} (x : Fin n → Fin d),
  ¬AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.IsAllEven x →
    ∑ e, AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signProduct e x = 0

Docstring: If an n-tuple is not all-even, then the sum over all sign tuples
of the sign product is zero (Lemma `lem.cancel.all-even.l2(a)`).

The proof uses an involution argument: if some element `k` has odd
multiplicity, flipping the sign of `e_k` negates the product, so
terms cancel in pairs.

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.IsAllEven (def)
{n d : ℕ} → (Fin n → Fin d) → Prop

Body:
fun {n d} x => ∀ (k : Fin d), Even {i | x i = k}.card

Docstring: An n-tuple `x : Fin n → Fin d` is "all-even" if each element of `Fin d`
occurs an even number of times. For example, the 4-tuple `(1,4,4,1)` is all-even
since 1 appears twice and 4 appears twice.

Label: Definition from Theorem `thm.cancel.all-even` 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signProduct (def)
{n d : ℕ} → (Fin d → ZMod 2) → (Fin n → Fin d) → ℤ

Body:
fun {n d} e x => ∏ i, AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.toSign (e (x i))

Docstring: The product `e_{x_1} * e_{x_2} * ... * e_{x_n}` for a sign tuple `e` and
index tuple `x` 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.toSign (def)
ZMod 2 → ℤ

Body:
fun b => if b = 0 then 1 else -1

Docstring: Convert a ZMod 2 value to a sign: 0 ↦ 1, 1 ↦ -1 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ZMod
ℕ → Type

Docstring: The integers modulo `n : ℕ`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Even
{α : Type u_2} → [Add α] → α → Prop

Docstring: An element `a` of a type `α` with addition satisfies `Even a` if `a = r + r`,
for some `r : α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instCommMonoid
CommMonoid ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.cancel.all-even.l2

Let $n,d\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $\left( x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\right) \in \left[ d\right] ^{n}$. 

\textbf{(a)} If the $n$-tuple $\left( x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\right)$ is not all-even, then $\sum _{\left( e_{1},\ldots ,e_{d}\right) \in \left\{  1,-1\right\}  ^{d}} e_{x_{1}}e_{x_{2}}\cdots e_{x_{n}}=0$. 

\textbf{(b)} If the $n$-tuple $\left( x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\right)$ is all-even, then $\sum _{\left( e_{1},\ldots ,e_{d}\right) \in \left\{  1,-1\right\}  ^{d}} e_{x_{1}}e_{x_{2}}\cdots e_{x_{n}}=2^{d}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.cancel.all-even
def.cancel.all-even

\leanhelper  Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $d\in \mathbb {N}$. An $n$-tuple $\left( x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\right) \in \left[ d\right] ^{n}$ is said to be \emph{all-even} if each element of $\left[ d\right] $ occurs an even number of times in this $n$-tuple (i.e., if for each $k\in \left[ d\right] $, the number of all $i\in \left[ n\right] $ satisfying $x_{i}=k$ is even).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "Both declarations match the two parts of the blueprint. The binders `\u2200 {n d : \u2115} (x : Fin n \u2192 Fin d)` encode an element of `[d]^n`. The dependency `IsAllEven x := \u2200 (k : Fin d), Even {i | x i = k}.card` exactly matches \u201ceach element of `[d]` occurs an even number of times.\u201d A summation variable `e : Fin d \u2192 ZMod 2`, together with `toSign b := if b = 0 then 1 else -1`, parametrizes all sign tuples in `{1,-1}^d`, and `signProduct e x := \u220f i, toSign (e (x i))` is exactly the product `e_{x\u2081}\u22efe_{x\u2099}`. Thus `\u00ac IsAllEven x \u2192 \u2211 e, signProduct e x = 0` matches part (a), while `IsAllEven x \u2192 \u2211 e, signProduct e x = 2 ^ d` matches part (b). The use of zero-based `Fin n` and `Fin d` instead of the blueprint\u2019s one-based `[n]` and `[d]` is only a canonical relabeling and introduces no mathematical restriction."
