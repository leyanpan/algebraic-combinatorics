Docstring: **Claim 2 from tex proof (discrete case)**: The family (∑_{k ∈ S_i} p_{i,k})_{i ∈ I} is multipliable.

For discrete K, this follows from coefficient-wise finiteness arguments. The key insight is that
∑_k p_{i,k} = 1 + ∑_{k≠0} p_{i,k}, and for discrete K, only finitely many finsets of indices
contribute to each coefficient of the partial products.

If `R` is a (unital) ring, then continuity of negation can be derived from continuity of
multiplication as it is multiplication with `-1`. (See

Body:
wrapped✝.1

Docstring: `∑' i, f i` is the unconditional sum of `f` if it exists, or 0 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∑'[L] i, f i` is the sum of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `0` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional sum exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice, to use the sum
over the support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a` satisfying `HasSum f a`. Similar remarks
apply to more general summation filters.)


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.multipliable-tsum-fiber-discrete

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Multipliability of the sum family.)} Under the same assumptions as Lemma \ref{lem.summable-fiber-discrete}, and assuming $p_{i,0}=1$ for all $i\in I$, the family $\left(\sum _{k\in S_i} p_{i,k}\right)_{i\in I}$ is multipliable.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.determines-xn-coeff

Let $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]^{I}$ be a (possibly infinite) family of FPSs. Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $M$ be a finite subset of $I$. 

\textbf{(a)} We say that $M$ \emph{determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the sum of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ if every finite subset $J$ of $I$ satisfying $M\subseteq J\subseteq I$ satisfies 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in J}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in M}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right).  \]

\textbf{(b)} We say that $M$ \emph{determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ if every finite subset $J$ of $I$ satisfying $M\subseteq J\subseteq I$ satisfies

\textbf{(b)} If the family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ is multipliable, then its \emph{product} $\prod _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS whose $x^{n}$-coefficient (for any $n\in \mathbb {N}$) can be computed as follows: If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $M$ is a finite subset of $I$ that determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of $\left( \mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$, then

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Summability of fibers.)} Let $I$ be a set. For any $i\in I$, let $S_i$ be a set containing $0$. For any $i\in I$ and $k\in S_i$, let $p_{i,k}\in K[[x]]$. Assume that the family $(p_{i,k})_{(i,k)\in \overline{S}}$ is summable (where $\overline{S} = \{ (i,k) : k\ne 0\} $). Then, for each $i\in I$, the family $(p_{i,k})_{k\in S_i}$ is summable.

For an infinite index type, the added family of constant terms need not be summable in a discrete coefficient ring, so the blueprint hypothesis cannot generally establish the formal hypothesis.

Together with `(\u2200 i, p i 0 = 1)`, this demands summability of all the added unit series across `I`, which is not implied by punctured-family summability. The Lean `Multipliable` conclusion in the pointwise topology is otherwise an appropriate topological encoding of coefficientwise finite determination over discrete `K`."
