## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAddCommMonoid
AddCommMonoid ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite.toFinset
{α : Type u} → {s : Set α} → s.Finite → Finset α

Docstring: Using choice, get the `Finset` that represents this `Set`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instNatCastInt
NatCast ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHMul
{α : Type u_1} → [Mul α] → HMul α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instMul
Mul ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Bool
Type

Docstring: The Boolean values, `true` and `false`.

Logically speaking, this is equivalent to `Prop` (the type of propositions). The distinction is
public important for programming: both propositions and their proofs are erased in the code generator,
while `Bool` corresponds to the Boolean type in most programming languages and carries precisely one
bit of run-time information.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Bool.true
Bool

Docstring: The Boolean value `true`, not to be confused with the proposition `True`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqBool
DecidableEq Bool

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Neg.neg
{α : Type u} → [self : Neg α] → α → α

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `neg` (when used as a unary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instNegInt
Neg ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix.vecCons
{α : Type u} → {n : ℕ} → α → (Fin n → α) → Fin n.succ → α

Docstring: `vecCons h t` prepends an entry `h` to a vector `t`.

The inverse functions are `vecHead` and `vecTail`.
The notation `![a, b, ...]` expands to `vecCons a (vecCons b ...)`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix.vecEmpty
{α : Type u} → Fin 0 → α

Docstring: `![]` is the vector with no entries. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.ncard
{α : Type u_1} → Set α → ℕ

Docstring: The cardinality of `s : Set α` . Has the junk value `0` if `s` is infinite 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.univ
{α : Type u} → Set α

Docstring: The universal set on a type `α` is the set containing all elements of `α`.

This is conceptually the "same as" `α` (in set theory, it is actually the same), but type theory
makes the distinction that `α` is a type while `Set.univ` is a term of type `Set α`. `Set.univ` can
itself be coerced to a type `↥Set.univ` which is in bijection with (but distinct from) `α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instLEInt
LE ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.decLe

Docstring: Decides whether `a ≤ b`.

```
#eval ¬ ( (7 : Int) ≤ (0 : Int) ) -- true
#eval (0 : Int) ≤ (0 : Int) -- true
#eval (7 : Int) ≤ (10 : Int) -- true
```

Implemented by efficient native code. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.choose
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Docstring: `choose n k` is the number of `k`-element subsets in an `n`-element set. Also known as binomial
coefficients. For the fact that this is the number of `k`-element-subsets of an `n`-element
set, see `Finset.card_powersetCard`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.toNat
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: Converts an integer into a natural number. Negative numbers are converted to `0`.

Examples:
* `(7 : Int).toNat = 7`
* `(0 : Int).toNat = 0`
* `(-7 : Int).toNat = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (List α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.foldl
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → (α → β → α) → α → List β → α

Docstring: Folds a function over a list from the left, accumulating a value starting with `init`. The
accumulated value is combined with the each element of the list in order, using `f`.

Examples:
 * `[a, b, c].foldl f z  = f (f (f z a) b) c`
 * `[1, 2, 3].foldl (· ++ toString ·) "" = "123"`
 * `[1, 2, 3].foldl (s!"({·} {·})") "" = "((( 1) 2) 3)"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.tail
{α : Type u} → List α → List α

Docstring: Drops the first element of a nonempty list, returning the tail. Returns `[]` when the argument is
empty.

Examples:
 * `["apple", "banana", "grape"].tail = ["banana", "grape"]`
 * `["apple"].tail = []`
 * `([] : List String).tail = []`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.cons
{α : Type u} → α → List α → List α

Docstring: The list whose first element is `head`, where `tail` is the rest of the list.
Usually written `head :: tail`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `::` in identifiers is `cons`.

 * The recommended spelling of `[a]` in identifiers is `singleton`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.scanl
{β : Type u_1} → {α : Type u_2} → (β → α → β) → β → List α → List β

Docstring: Fold a function `f` over the list from the left, returning the list of partial results.
```
scanl (+) 0 [1, 2, 3] = [0, 1, 3, 6]
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Disjoint
{α : Type u_1} → [inst : PartialOrder α] → [OrderBot α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: Two elements of a lattice are disjoint if their inf is the bottom element.
  (This generalizes disjoint sets, viewed as members of the subset lattice.)

Note that we define this without reference to `⊓`, as this allows us to talk about orders where
the infimum is not unique, or where implementing `Inf` would require additional `Decidable`
arguments. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ChainCompletePartialOrder.toPartialOrder
{α : Type u_2} → [self : ChainCompletePartialOrder α] → PartialOrder α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ChainCompletePartialOrder.instOfCompleteLattice
{α : Type u_1} → [CompleteLattice α] → ChainCompletePartialOrder α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CompleteBooleanAlgebra.toCompleteLattice
{α : Type u_1} → [self : CompleteBooleanAlgebra α] → CompleteLattice α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CompleteAtomicBooleanAlgebra.toCompleteBooleanAlgebra
{α : Type u} → [self : CompleteAtomicBooleanAlgebra α] → CompleteBooleanAlgebra α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instCompleteAtomicBooleanAlgebra
{α : Type u_1} → CompleteAtomicBooleanAlgebra (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HeytingAlgebra.toOrderBot
{α : Type u_4} → [self : HeytingAlgebra α] → OrderBot α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Order.Frame.toHeytingAlgebra
{α : Type u_1} → [self : Order.Frame α] → HeytingAlgebra α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CompleteDistribLattice.toFrame
{α : Type u_1} → [self : CompleteDistribLattice α] → Order.Frame α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CompleteBooleanAlgebra.toCompleteDistribLattice
{α : Type u} → [CompleteBooleanAlgebra α] → CompleteDistribLattice α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format
Type

Docstring: A representation of a set of strings, in which the placement of newlines and indentation differ.

Given a specific line width, specified in columns, the string that uses the fewest lines can be
selected.

The pretty-printing algorithm is based on Wadler's paper
[_A Prettier Printer_](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Repr.addAppParen
Format → ℕ → Format

Docstring: Adds parentheses to `f` if the precedence `prec` from the context is at least that of function
application.

Together with `reprArg`, this can be used to correctly parenthesize function application
syntax.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.group
Format → optParam Std.Format.FlattenBehavior Std.Format.FlattenBehavior.allOrNone → Format

Docstring: Creates a new flattening group for the given inner `Format`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.nest
ℤ → Format → Format

Docstring: `nest indent f` increases the current indentation level by `indent` while rendering `f`.

Example:
```lean example
open Std Format in
def fmtList (l : List Format) : Format :=
  let f := joinSep l  (", " ++ Format.line)
  group (nest 1 <| "[" ++ f ++ "]")
```

This will be written all on one line, but if the text is too large, the formatter will put in
linebreaks after the commas and indent later lines by 1.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.text
String → Format

Docstring: A node containing a plain string.

If the string contains newlines, the formatter emits them and then indents to the current level.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.FlattenBehavior.allOrNone
Std.Format.FlattenBehavior

Docstring: Either all `Format.line`s in the group will be newlines, or all of them will be spaces.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.lgv.2paths.partition

\leanhelper  The sum over all signed path tuples decomposes as: 

\begin{align*} & \bigl(\text{\#  of path tuples from } (A,A’) \text{ to } (B,B’)\bigr) - \bigl(\text{\#  of path tuples from } (A,A’) \text{ to } (B’,B)\bigr) \\ & = \sum _{(p,p') \in \mathcal{A}} \operatorname {sign}(p,p’), \end{align*}

 and the sum over nipats gives: 

\begin{align*}  \sum _{(p,p') \in \mathcal{A} \setminus \mathcal{X}} \operatorname {sign}(p,p’) & = \bigl(\text{\#  of nipats from } (A,A’) \text{ to } (B,B’)\bigr) \\ & \quad - \bigl(\text{\#  of nipats from } (A,A’) \text{ to } (B’,B)\bigr). \end{align*}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.lattice
def.lgv.lattice

We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ (so the vertices are pairs of integers) and arcs 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i+1,j\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}  \]

 and 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i,j+1\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}.  \]

 The arcs of the first form are called \emph{east-steps} or \emph{right-steps}; the arcs of the second form are called \emph{north-steps} or \emph{up-steps}. 

The vertices of this digraph will be called \emph{lattice points} or \emph{grid points} or simply \emph{points}. 

The entire digraph will be denoted by $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ and called the \emph{integer lattice} or \emph{integer grid}. 

Any path is uniquely determined by its starting point and its step sequence.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.path-tups
def.lgv.path-tups

Let $k\in \mathbb {N}$. 

\textbf{(a)} A $k$\emph{-vertex} means a $k$-tuple of lattice points. 

\textbf{(b)} If $\mathbf{A}=\left( A_{1},A_{2},\ldots ,A_{k}\right) $ is a $k$-vertex, and if $\sigma \in S_{k}$ is a permutation, then $\sigma \left( \mathbf{A}\right) $ shall denote the $k$-vertex $\left( A_{\sigma \left( 1\right) },A_{\sigma \left( 2\right) },\ldots ,A_{\sigma \left( k\right) }\right) $. 

\textbf{(c)} If $\mathbf{A}=\left( A_{1},A_{2},\ldots ,A_{k}\right) $ and $\mathbf{B}=\left( B_{1},B_{2},\ldots ,B_{k}\right) $ are two $k$-vertices, then a \emph{path tuple} from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ means a $k$-tuple $\left( p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}\right) $, where each $p_{i}$ is a path from $A_{i}$ to $B_{i}$. 

\textbf{(d)} A path tuple $\left( p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}\right) $ is said to be \emph{non-intersecting} if no two of the paths $p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}$ have any vertex in common. We abbreviate “non-intersecting path tuple” as \emph{nipat}. 

\textbf{(e)} A path tuple $\left( p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}\right) $ is said to be \emph{intersecting} if it is not non-intersecting (i.e., if two of its paths have a vertex in common). We abbreviate “intersecting path tuple” as \emph{ipat}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.signed-pathtup2
def.lgv.signed-pathtup2

\leanhelper  Given four lattice points $A, A', B, B'$: 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{signed path tuple} is a pair of paths $(p_0, p_1)$ together with a sign flag indicating whether the destinations are $(B, B')$ (sign $+1$) or $(B', B)$ (sign $-1$). 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{path count matrix} is the $2 \times 2$ integer matrix with entries $\# \mathrm{paths}(A_i \to B_j)$. 

\textbf{(c)} The number of nipats from $(A, A')$ to $(B, B')$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The two declarations exactly match the two blueprint equalities. `sum_signedPathTuples2` states that the signed sum over `signedPathTuples2 ... = Set.univ` is `\u2191(numPaths A B) * \u2191(numPaths A' B') - \u2191(numPaths A B') * \u2191(numPaths A' B)`, i.e. the number of tuples to `(B,B')` minus the number to `(B',B)`. `sum_signedNipats2` sums over `signedNipats2 ... = {spt | \u00ac spt.isIntersecting}` and equates it to `\u2191(numNipats2 A A' B B') - \u2191(numNipats2 A A' B' B)`, exactly the corresponding nipat difference. The sign definition, `if spt.toBB' = true then 1 else -1`, agrees with the informal sign convention. The binders `hfin : (...).Finite` are an encoding requirement for forming `hfin.toFinset`, not a mathematically contentful restriction: with east/north finite step lists and fixed endpoints, these path-tuple sets are finite. Reversing the order of the first displayed blueprint equality (count difference equals sum versus sum equals count difference) is immaterial by symmetry of equality."
