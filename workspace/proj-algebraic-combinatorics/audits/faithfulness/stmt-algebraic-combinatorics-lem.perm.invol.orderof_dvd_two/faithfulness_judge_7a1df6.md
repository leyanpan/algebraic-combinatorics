## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution.orderOf_dvd_two (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {X : Type u_1} [Fintype X] {σ : Equiv.Perm X}, AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution σ → orderOf σ ∣ 2

Docstring: The order of an involution divides 2. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution (def)
{X : Type u_1} → Equiv.Perm X → Prop

Body:
fun {X} σ => σ * σ = 1

Docstring: A permutation is an involution if `σ ∘ σ = id`. (def.perm.invol)

From the textbook:
> An *involution* of X means a map f: X → X that satisfies f ∘ f = id.
> Clearly, an involution is always a permutation, and equals its own inverse.

Equivalent characterizations:
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ σ * σ = 1` (definition)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ σ⁻¹ = σ` (see `isInvolution_iff_eq_inv`)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ Function.Involutive σ` (see `isInvolution_iff_involutive`)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ ∀ x, σ (σ x) = x` (see `isInvolution_iff_forall`)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Dvd.dvd
{α : Type u_1} → [self : Dvd α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: Divisibility. `a ∣ b` (typed as `\|`) means that there is some `c` such that `b = a * c`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∣` in identifiers is `dvd`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instDvd
Dvd ℕ

Docstring: Divisibility of natural numbers. `a ∣ b` (typed as `\|`) says that
there is some `c` such that `b = a * c`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF orderOf
{G : Type u_1} → [Monoid G] → G → ℕ

Docstring: `orderOf x` is the order of the element `x`, i.e. the `n ≥ 1`, s.t. `x ^ n = 1` if it exists.
Otherwise, i.e. if `x` is of infinite order, then `orderOf x` is `0` by convention. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DivInvMonoid.toMonoid
{G : Type u} → [self : DivInvMonoid G] → Monoid G

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Group.toDivInvMonoid
{G : Type u} → [self : Group G] → DivInvMonoid G

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.permGroup
{α : Type u_4} → Group (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHMul
{α : Type u_1} → [Mul α] → HMul α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instMul
{α : Type u_4} → Mul (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF One.toOfNat1
{α : Type u_1} → [One α] → OfNat α 1

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instOne
{α : Type u_4} → One (Equiv.Perm α)

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.invol.orderOf_dvd_two

\leanhelper  The order of an involution divides $2$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The elaborated target quantifies `\u2200 {X : Type u_1} [Fintype X] {\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm X}, ...`, while the blueprint says without qualification: \u201cThe order of an involution divides 2.\u201d Its accompanying definition describes an involution of an arbitrary `X`, with no finiteness assumption. The binder `[Fintype X]` therefore restricts the theorem to finite carrier types and is mathematically unnecessary: from `\u03c3 * \u03c3 = 1`, `orderOf \u03c3 \u2223 2` holds in the permutation group even when `X` is infinite. To be faithful, remove `[Fintype X]` from `AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution.orderOf_dvd_two`."
