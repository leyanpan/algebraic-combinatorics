Docstring: A sequence of FPSs `(f_i)_{i ∈ ℕ}` coefficientwise stabilizes to `f` if for each `n ∈ ℕ`,
the sequence `([x^n] f_i)_{i ∈ ℕ}` stabilizes to `[x^n] f`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

is semilinear if it satisfies the two properties `f (x + y) = f x + f y` and
`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time.

Docstring: The `n`th coefficient of a formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.fps.lim.sum-prod

Assume that $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ and $\left( g_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ are two sequences of FPSs, and that $f$ and $g$ are two FPSs such that

\[  \lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }f_{i}=f\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }g_{i}=g.  \]

 Then, 

\[  \lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }\left( f_{i}+g_{i}\right) =f+g\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }\left( f_{i}g_{i}\right) =fg.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.coeff-stab
def.fps.lim.coeff-stab

Let $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] ^{\mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of FPSs over $K$. Let $f\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $ be an FPS. 

We say that $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ \emph{coefficientwise stabilizes to }$f$ if for each $n\in \mathbb {N}$,

\[  \text{the sequence }\left( \left[ x^{n}\right] f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}\text{ stabilizes to }\left[ x^{n}\right] f.  \]

If $f_{i}$ coefficientwise stabilizes to $f$ as $i\rightarrow \infty $, then we write $\lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }f_{i}=f$ and say that $f$ is the \emph{limit} of $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$. This is legitimate, because $f$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.stab
def.fps.lim.stab

Let $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of elements of $K$. Let $a\in K$. 

We say that the sequence $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ \emph{stabilizes to }$a$ if there exists some $N\in \mathbb {N}$ such that

\[  \text{all integers }i\geq N\text{ satisfy }a_{i}=a.  \]

If $a_{i}$ stabilizes to $a$ as $i\rightarrow \infty $, then we write $\lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }a_{i}=a$ and say that $a$ is the \emph{limit} (or \emph{eventual value}) of $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$. This is legitimate, since $a$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "Both elaborated targets add the mathematically contentful binder `[inst : CommRing K]`, and the dependency `PowerSeries.CoeffStabilizesTo` itself is restricted by `{K} \u2192 [CommRing K] \u2192 ...`. The blueprint merely assumes \u201ctwo sequences of FPSs\u201d and defines their sum and Cauchy product; nowhere in the supplied statement or informal definitions does it require multiplication in `K` to be commutative. Thus the Lean declarations prove the claims only over commutative rings, a narrower setting than the blueprint specifies. Apart from this restriction, the two declarations together match the two conjuncts: `(fun i => f i + g i)` stabilizes to `lf + lg`, and `(fun i => f i * g i)` stabilizes to `lf * lg`, using the stated coefficientwise stabilization definition. To make the formalization faithful, weaken the binder in `PowerSeries.CoeffStabilizesTo` and in both targets to an algebraic structure sufficient for the FPS operations\u2014e.g. `[Semiring K]` with the available `PowerSeries.coeff` and multiplication APIs (or otherwise the weakest structure supported by revised dependencies)."
