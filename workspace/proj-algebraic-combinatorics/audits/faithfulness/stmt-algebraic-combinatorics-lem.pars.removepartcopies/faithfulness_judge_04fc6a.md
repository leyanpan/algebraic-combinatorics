## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

Docstring: `Multiset α` is the quotient of `List α` by list permutation. The result
is a type of finite sets with duplicates allowed.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.replicate
{α : Type u_1} → ℕ → α → Multiset α

Docstring: `replicate n a` is the multiset containing only `a` with multiplicity `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.pars.removePartCopies

\leanhelper  If a partition $p$ of $n$ contains $j$ or more copies of a part $d$, then removing $j$ copies of $d$ yields a valid partition of $n - d \cdot j$. Conversely, adding $j$ copies of a positive integer $d$ to a partition of $m$ yields a partition of $m + d \cdot j$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The two definitions exactly implement the two directions. `removePartCopies` takes `p : n.Partition` and `j \u2264 Multiset.count d p.parts`, matching \u201ca partition p of n contains j or more copies of a part d,\u201d and returns `(n - d * j).Partition`, matching the claimed resulting size. Its binder `d > 0` is justified by calling `d` a \u201cpart,\u201d since the informal definition requires all partition parts to be positive. Conversely, `addPartCopies` takes `q : m.Partition`, `d j : \u2115`, and `d > 0`, and returns `(m + d * j).Partition`, exactly matching \u201cadding j copies of a positive integer d \u2026 yields a partition of m + d \u00b7 j.\u201d The bodies use `Multiset.replicate j d` and multiset addition/subtraction, which encode adding or removing precisely `j` indistinguishable copies. Representing weakly decreasing tuples as multisets preserves the mathematical notion of partition."
