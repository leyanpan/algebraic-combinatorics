## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Determinants.polyCauchyMat'_det_dvd_y_sub_y (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (m : ℕ) (i j : Fin m),
  i ≠ j →
    MvPolynomial.X (Sum.inr i) - MvPolynomial.X (Sum.inr j) ∣ (AlgebraicCombinatorics.Determinants.polyCauchyMat' m).det

Docstring: The determinant of the polynomial Cauchy matrix is divisible by (y_i - y_j) for i ≠ j. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Determinants.polyCauchyMat' (def)
(m : ℕ) → Matrix (Fin m) (Fin m) (MvPolynomial (Fin m ⊕ Fin m) ℤ)

Body:
fun m => Matrix.of fun i j => ∏ k with k ≠ j, (MvPolynomial.X (Sum.inl i) + MvPolynomial.X (Sum.inr k))

Docstring: The polynomial Cauchy matrix over MvPolynomial (Fin n ⊕ Fin n) ℤ.
Entry (i, j) is ∏_{k ≠ j} (X_{inl i} + X_{inr k}). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Dvd.dvd
{α : Type u_1} → [self : Dvd α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: Divisibility. `a ∣ b` (typed as `\|`) means that there is some `c` such that `b = a * c`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∣` in identifiers is `dvd`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sum
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The disjoint union of types `α` and `β`, ordinarily written `α ⊕ β`.

An element of `α ⊕ β` is either an `a : α` wrapped in `Sum.inl` or a `b : β` wrapped in `Sum.inr`.
`α ⊕ β` is not equivalent to the set-theoretic union of `α` and `β` because its values include an
indication of which of the two types was chosen. The union of a singleton set with itself contains
one element, while `Unit ⊕ Unit` contains distinct values `inl ()` and `inr ()`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

CommRing ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix
Type u → Type u' → Type v → Type (max u u' v)

Docstring: `Matrix m n R` is the type of matrices with entries in `R`, whose rows are indexed by `m`
and whose columns are indexed by `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv
Sort u_1 → Sort u_2 → Sort (max (max 1 u_1) u_2)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix.of
{m : Type u_2} → {n : Type u_3} → {α : Type v} → (m → n → α) ≃ Matrix m n α

Docstring: Cast a function into a matrix.

The two sides of the equivalence are definitionally equal types. We want to use an explicit cast
to distinguish the types because `Matrix` has different instances to pi types (such as `Pi.mul`,
which performs elementwise multiplication, vs `Matrix.mul`).

If you are defining a matrix, in terms of its entries, use `of (fun i j ↦ _)`. The
purpose of this approach is to ensure that terms of the form `(fun i j ↦ _) * (fun i j ↦ _)` do not
appear, as the type of `*` can be misleading.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommMonoid
{α : Type u} → [self : CommRing α] → CommMonoid α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableNot
{p : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → Decidable ¬p

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.det.cauchy-poly-dvd-y

\leanhelper  For distinct $i, j$, we have $(Y_i - Y_j) \mid \det (C(m))$, where $C(m)$ is the polynomial Cauchy matrix from Lemma~ \ref{lem.det.cauchy-poly-dvd-x}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies `\u2200 (m : \u2115) (i j : Fin m), i \u2260 j` and concludes `X (Sum.inr i) - X (Sum.inr j) \u2223 (polyCauchyMat' m).det`, exactly matching \u201cFor distinct $i,j$, we have $(Y_i-Y_j) \\mid \\det(C(m))$.\u201d The dependency `polyCauchyMat'` is the polynomial Cauchy matrix with entries `\u220f k with k \u2260 j, (X (Sum.inl i) + X (Sum.inr k))`; thus the `Sum.inr` variables are precisely the $Y$-variables. The `Fin m` indices encode the matrix\u2019s index range, and the determinant\u2019s decidable-equality and finite-type requirements are supplied canonically rather than imposed as additional mathematical hypotheses."
