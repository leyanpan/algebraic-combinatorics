∀ {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] {I : Type u_2} [inst_1 : DecidableEq I] (p : I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) (In : Finset I)
  (S : I → Finset ℕ), ∏ i ∈ In, ∑ k ∈ S i, p i k = ∑ f ∈ Fintype.piFinset fun i => S ↑i, ∏ i, p (↑i) (f i)

Docstring: Claim 11: For finite `I_n`, `∏_{i ∈ I_n} ∑_{k ∈ S_i} p_{i,k} =
∑_{(k_i) ∈ S^{I_n}} ∏_{i ∈ I_n} p_{i,k_i}`.
(Claim 11) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`.

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSetLike
{α : Type u_1} → SetLike (Finset α) α

Docstring: Convert a finset to a set in the natural way. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.piFinset
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → {δ : α → Type u_4} → ((a : α) → Finset (δ a)) → Finset ((a : α) → δ a)

Docstring: Given for all `a : α` a finset `t a` of `δ a`, then one can define the
finset `Fintype.piFinset t` of all functions taking values in `t a` for all `a`. This is the
analogue of `Finset.pi` where the base finset is `univ` (but formally they are not the same, as
there is an additional condition `i ∈ Finset.univ` in the `Finset.pi` definition). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.instDecidableEq
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → [DecidableEq α] → DecidableEq { x // p x }

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.Subtype.fintype

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.infprod.claim11

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Claim 11.)} For a finite index set $I_n$, 

\[  \prod _{i \in I_n} \sum _{k \in S_i} p_{i,k} = \sum _{(k_i) \in S^{I_n}} \prod _{i \in I_n} p_{i,k_i}.  \]

 This is the standard finite distributive law (product of sums equals sum of products).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The finite-index combinatorics are represented correctly: `In : Finset I` encodes the finite set `I_n`, and `Fintype.piFinset fun i => S \u2191i` indexes exactly the choices `(k_i) \u2208 S^{I_n}` over the subtype `{i // i \u2208 In}`. However, the target restricts the factors through the binders `{K : Type u_1} [CommRing K]` and `p : I \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 PowerSeries K`. The blueprint only states \u201cFor a finite index set `I_n`\u201d and calls this the standard finite distributive law; it does not specify that the `p_{i,k}` must be formal power series over a commutative ring. Thus the Lean theorem proves only a specialized instance and does not imply the unrestricted blueprint law. `[DecidableEq I]` is merely an encoding requirement for finsets and is not substantive drift. To make the declaration faithful, generalize the codomain of `p` to an arbitrary carrier with the algebraic structure needed for finite sums, finite products, and distributivity (rather than `PowerSeries K` with `[CommRing K]`), or amend the informal statement/definition to explicitly place every `p_{i,k}` in `PowerSeries K` for a commutative ring `K`."
