## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.InclusionExclusion.Derangement.id_not_derangement (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {α : Type u_1} [Nonempty α] (d : AlgebraicCombinatorics.InclusionExclusion.Derangement α), ↑d ≠ 1

Docstring: The identity is NOT a derangement when the type is nonempty.
This matches the textbook example: D₁ = 0, since id(1) = 1 is a fixed point. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.InclusionExclusion.Derangement (def)
Type u_1 → Type (max 0 u_1)

Body:
fun α => { σ // ∀ (x : α), σ x ≠ x }

Docstring: **Definition `def.pie.dera`**: A derangement of a type `α` is a permutation with no fixed points.

This is definitionally equal to `↥(derangements α)` from `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Derangements.Basic`.

**Textbook definition:** "A derangement of a set X means a permutation of X that has no fixed points."

**Examples from the textbook:**
- D₀ = 1: The identity on ∅ is a derangement (vacuously no fixed points)
- D₁ = 0: The identity on {0} fixes 0, so it's not a derangement
- D₂ = 1: Only the swap (0 1) is a derangement
- D₃ = 2: The two 3-cycles (0 1 2) and (0 2 1) are derangements 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nonempty
Sort u → Prop

Docstring: `Nonempty α` is a typeclass that says that `α` is not an empty type,
that is, there exists an element in the type. It differs from `Inhabited α`
in that `Nonempty α` is a `Prop`, which means that it does not actually carry
an element of `α`, only a proof that *there exists* such an element.
Given `Nonempty α`, you can construct an element of `α` *nonconstructively*
using `Classical.choice`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF One.toOfNat1
{α : Type u_1} → [One α] → OfNat α 1

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instOne
{α : Type u_4} → One (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Identity is not a derangement of nonempty types

\leanhelper  If $\alpha $ is nonempty, then no derangement of $\alpha $ equals the identity permutation. In particular $D_1 = 0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pie.dera
def.pie.dera

A \emph{derangement} of a set $X$ means a permutation of $X$ that has no fixed points.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binder `\u2200 {\u03b1 : Type u_1} [Nonempty \u03b1] (d : ...Derangement \u03b1)` exactly covers every derangement of every nonempty type. By the dependency body, such a `d` is a permutation satisfying `\u2200 x, d x \u2260 x`. The conclusion `\u2191d \u2260 1` says its underlying permutation is not `1`, which for `Equiv.Perm \u03b1` is the identity permutation. Thus it matches \u201cIf \u03b1 is nonempty, then no derangement of \u03b1 equals the identity permutation.\u201d For a singleton type every permutation is the identity, so this also yields the stated special case `D\u2081 = 0`."
