## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions.

{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Type

Body:
SkewYoungTableau.mk : {N : ℕ} →
  [inst : NeZero N] →
    {lam mu : NPartition N} →
      (entry : Fin N × ℕ → Fin N) → (∀ c ∉ skewYoungDiagram lam mu, entry c = 0) → SkewYoungTableau lam mu

Docstring: A skew Young tableau of shape λ/μ is a filling of Y(λ/μ) with elements of [N].
Definition \ref{def.sf.skew-tab} in the source.

Formally, a Young tableau of shape λ/μ is a map T : Y(λ/μ) → [N].
We represent this as a total function `entry : Fin N × ℕ → Fin N` with a support
condition that entries outside the skew diagram are 0.

Young tableaux of shape λ/μ are often called "skew Young tableaux".

Note: If μ ⊈ λ (i.e., not μ ≤ λ), then there are no Young tableaux of shape λ/μ
because the skew diagram would be empty or malformed. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => lam.youngDiagram \ mu.youngDiagram

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is the set difference Y(λ) \ Y(μ).
Definition \ref{def.sf.skew-diag} in the source.

**Note**: This is a duplicate of `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` that requires `[NeZero N]`.
Prefer `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` for new code as it works for all `N`.

For N-partitions λ and μ with μ ⊆ λ, the skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is defined as:
```
Y(λ) \ Y(μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ [λ_i] \ [μ_i]}
            = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ ℤ and μ_i < j ≤ λ_i}
```
(The second form uses 1-indexed j as in the textbook.)

In our 0-indexed formalization, this becomes:
```
Y(λ/μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ Fin N and μ_i ≤ j < λ_i}
```

Example: Y((4,3,1)/(2,1,0)) consists of cells:
- Row 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)  (since μ₀ = 2, λ₀ = 4)
- Row 1: (1, 1), (1, 2)  (since μ₁ = 1, λ₁ = 3)
- Row 2: (2, 0)          (since μ₂ = 0, λ₂ = 1) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SkewYoungTableau.entry (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → {lam mu : NPartition N} → SkewYoungTableau lam mu → Fin N × ℕ → Fin N

Body:

Docstring: The filling function T : Y(λ/μ) → [N] 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.youngDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} μ => Finset.univ.biUnion fun i => Finset.map { toFun := fun j => (i, j), inj' := ⋯ } (Finset.range (μ.parts i))

Docstring: The Young diagram Y(λ) of an N-partition λ is the set of cells (i, j) where
i ∈ Fin N and j < λ_i.
Definition def.sf.ydiag in the source.

Note: Mathlib has `YoungDiagram` which is more general (infinite diagrams).
Here we define a version specific to N-partitions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF NeZero
{R : Type u_1} → [Zero R] → R → Prop

Docstring: A type-class version of `n ≠ 0`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instCommSemiring
CommSemiring ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is antitone if `a ≤ b` implies `f b ≤ f a`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.instPartialOrder
{n : ℕ} → PartialOrder (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instPreorder
Preorder ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → [NeZero n] → {i : ℕ} → OfNat (Fin n) i

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SDiff.sdiff
{α : Type u} → [self : SDiff α] → α → α → α

consisting of all elements in `a` that are not in `b`.

Docstring: `Finset.biUnion s t` is the union of `t a` over `a ∈ s`.

(This was formerly `bind` due to the monad structure on types with `DecidableEq`.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α ↪ β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Embedding.mk

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.ytab.skew-xT

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. If $T$ is any Young tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $, then we define the corresponding monomial

\[  x_{T}:=\prod _{c\text{ is a box of }Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) }x_{T\left( c\right) }=\prod _{\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) }x_{T\left( i,j\right) }=\prod _{k=1}^{N}x_{k}^{\left( \text{\#  of times }k\text{ appears in }T\right) }.  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unstatable",
  "justification": "The blueprint says, without a positivity condition, \u201cLet \u03bb and \u03bc be two N-partitions. If T is any Young tableau of shape \u03bb/\u03bc,\u201d whereas the elaborated target has the additional binder `{N : \u2115} \u2192 [inst : NeZero N] \u2192`. This restriction enters through the dependency `SkewYoungTableau`, whose signature itself requires `[NeZero N]`; `skewYoungDiagram` also carries that binder. Since `NPartition N` is defined for every natural `N`, including `0`, the package does not justify silently restricting the blueprint to nonzero `N`. The body `\u220f c \u2208 skewYoungDiagram lam mu, MvPolynomial.X (T.entry c)` otherwise directly matches the displayed product over boxes (up to the formalization\u2019s zero-based `Fin N` indexing). To state the blueprint for all `N`, `SkewYoungTableau` would need to be generalized to `N = 0`\u2014for example by defining entries only on the diagram rather than as a total function requiring an outside value `0 : Fin N`\u2014and the all-`N` skew-diagram definition should be used; then the target\u2019s `[NeZero N]` binder could be removed."
