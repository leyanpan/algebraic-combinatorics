## TARGET EssentiallyFinite (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A type with a zero element. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.support
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (ι → M) → Set ι

Docstring: `support` of a function is the set of points `x` such that `f x ≠ 0`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin

\textbf{(a)} A sequence $\left( k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\ldots \right) $ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in \left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  $ satisfy $k_{i}=0$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} A family $\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in I}$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $k_{i}=0$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The body `(Function.support f).Finite`, together with `Function.support` meaning `{i | f i \u2260 0}`, says that only finitely many indices have nonzero values. This is exactly the informal condition that \u201call but finitely many i \u2208 I satisfy k_i = 0.\u201d The binders `{I : Type u_2} \u2192 {M : Type u_3} \u2192 [Zero M] \u2192 (I \u2192 M) \u2192 Prop` express the arbitrary indexed family in part (b), and part (a) is its specialization to the sequence index set. Allowing any value type `M` equipped only with zero is a harmless generalization of the unspecified values `k_i`."
