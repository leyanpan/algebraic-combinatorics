Docstring: A semistandard tableau T of shape λ/μ is ν-Yamanouchi if for each positive integer j,
the N-tuple ν + cont(col_{≥j}(T)) is an N-partition (i.e., weakly decreasing).

**Definition (def.sf.yamanouchi)**:
Let λ, μ, ν be three N-partitions. A semistandard tableau T of shape λ/μ is said to be
ν-Yamanouchi if for each positive integer j, the N-tuple ν + cont(col_{≥j}T) ∈ ℕ^N is
an N-partition (i.e., weakly decreasing).

**Key properties:**
- The condition ensures that as we process the tableau column by column from right to left,
  starting with tally ν, the running tally always remains weakly decreasing.
- For j = 1, we get that ν + cont(T) is an N-partition (see `IsYamanouchi.isNPartition_add_content`).
- A 0-Yamanouchi tableau (also called a "ballot tableau") has content that is itself an N-partition.

**Voting interpretation (rmk.sf.yamanouchi.votes):**
Think of each entry i in T as a vote for candidate i. Starting with tally ν and counting votes
column by column from right to left, the tally must remain weakly decreasing at every step.
Since columns have distinct entries (strictly increasing), no candidate gains more than one
vote at a time.

      (↑c₁).2 = (↑c₂).2 → (↑c₁).1 < (↑c₂).1 → T c₁ < T c₂

Docstring: A tableau is semistandard if entries weakly increase along rows
and strictly increase down columns. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {N} lam => IsNPartition lam

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of natural numbers.
(Used throughout the source)

This is an alias for the canonical definition in `NPartition.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → ℕ → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} T j i => Nat.card { c // T ⟨↑c, ⋯⟩ = i }

Docstring: The content of a restricted tableau col_{≥j}(T).
Counts occurrences of each value in columns j and beyond. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Set (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => {c | mu c.1 < c.2 ∧ c.2 ≤ lam c.1}

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(lam/mu) as a set of cells.
A cell (i,j) is in Y(lam/mu) if mu_i < j ≤ lam_i.

**This is the `Set` version with 1-indexed columns (textbook convention).**
The first column is j = 1, not j = 0.

For the canonical `Finset` version with 0-indexed columns, see:
- `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` in NPartition.lean (canonical, no `[NeZero N]` required)
- `skewYoungDiagram` in SchurBasics.lean (duplicate, requires `[NeZero N]`)

Comparison:
- Here: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i < j ≤ λ_i (1-indexed)
- NPartition/SchurBasics: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i ≤ j < λ_i (0-indexed)

The bijection between them is: (i, j) here ↔ (i, j-1) in NPartition/SchurBasics.
See `SchurBasics.mem_skewYoungDiagram_iff_mem_LR_shifted` for the conversion lemma. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY IsNPartition (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {N} lam => ∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → lam j ≤ lam i

Docstring: An N-partition predicate: an N-tuple is an N-partition if it is weakly decreasing.
This is equivalent to `Antitone` for functions `Fin N → ℕ`.
(Used throughout the source) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Pi.instAdd
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : ι → Type u_5} → [(i : ι) → Add (M i)] → Add ((i : ι) → M i)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.card
Type u_3 → ℕ

Docstring: `Nat.card α` is the cardinality of `α` as a natural number.
If `α` is infinite, `Nat.card α = 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.yamanouchi

Let $\lambda ,\mu ,\nu $ be three $N$-partitions. A semistandard tableau $T$ of shape $\lambda /\mu $ is said to be $\nu $-\emph{Yamanouchi} (this is an adjective) if for each positive integer $j$, the $N$-tuple $\nu +\operatorname *{cont}\left( \operatorname {col}_{\geq j}T\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ is an $N$-partition (i.e., weakly decreasing).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.col-tab
def.sf.col-tab

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. Let $T$ be a tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $. Let $j$ be a positive integer. Then, $\operatorname {col}_{\geq j}T$ means the restriction of $T$ to columns $j,j+1,j+2,\ldots $ (that is, the result of removing the first $j-1$ columns from $T$). Formally speaking, this means the restriction of the map $T$ to the set $\left\{  \left( u,v\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \  \mid \  v\geq j\right\}  $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.content
def.sf.content

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. Let $T$ be a tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $. We define the \emph{content} of $T$ to be the $N$-tuple $\left( a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{N}\right) $, where

\[  a_{i}:=\left( \text{\#  of }i\text{'s in }T\right) =\left( \text{\#  of boxes }c\text{ of }T\text{ such that }T\left( c\right) =i\right) .  \]

 We denote this $N$-tuple by $\operatorname *{cont}T$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-tab
def.sf.skew-tab

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions such that $\mu \subseteq \lambda $. A \emph{Young tableau} of shape $\lambda /\mu $ means a way of filling the boxes of $Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ with elements of $\left[ N\right] $ (one element per box). Formally speaking, it is defined as a map $T:Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $. 

Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $ are often called \emph{skew Young tableaux}. 

If we don’t have $\mu \subseteq \lambda $, then we agree that there are no Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target body matches the defining condition: it requires `AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsSemistandard T` and `\u2200 j > 0, AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition (nu + AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq T j)`, corresponding exactly to \u201cA semistandard tableau \u2026 if for each positive integer j, the N-tuple \u03bd + cont(col_{\u2265j} T) is an N-partition.\u201d The dependency `contentColGeq` is documented as counting entries in columns `j` and beyond, and `IsNPartition` unfolds to weak decrease. The signature `{lam mu : Fin N \u2192 \u2115} \u2192 (Fin N \u2192 \u2115) \u2192 ...` does not require \u03bb, \u03bc, or \u03bd themselves to be N-partitions, although the blueprint introduces them as such. This makes the formal definition strictly more general, not weaker on the blueprint\u2019s intended domain, so it remains faithful under the stated standard. Likewise, defining tableaux for additional malformed shapes only extends the formal domain; it does not alter the condition for the tableaux covered by the blueprint."
