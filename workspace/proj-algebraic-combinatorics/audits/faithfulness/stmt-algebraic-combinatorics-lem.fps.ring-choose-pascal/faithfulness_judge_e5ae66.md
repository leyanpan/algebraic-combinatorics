## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.Ring_choose_pascal (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] [inst_1 : BinomialRing K] (c : K) (k : ℕ),
  Ring.choose c (k + 1) = Ring.choose (c - 1) k + Ring.choose (c - 1) (k + 1)

Docstring: Pascal identity for Ring.choose: C(c, k+1) = C(c-1, k) + C(c-1, k+1) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF BinomialRing
(R : Type u_1) → [AddCommMonoid R] → [Pow R ℕ] → Type u_1

Docstring: A binomial ring is a ring for which ascending Pochhammer evaluations are uniquely divisible by
suitable factorials. We define this notion as a mixin for additive commutative monoids with natural
number powers, but retain the ring name. We introduce `Ring.multichoose` as the uniquely defined
quotient.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ring.choose
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : AddCommGroupWithOne R] → [inst_1 : Pow R ℕ] → [BinomialRing R] → R → ℕ → R

Docstring: The binomial coefficient `choose r n` generalizes the natural number `Nat.choose` function,
interpreted in terms of choosing without replacement.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.Ring-choose-pascal

\leanhelper  Pascal’s rule for generalized binomial coefficients: 

\[  \binom {c}{k+1} = \binom {c-1}{k} + \binom {c-1}{k+1}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unstatable",
  "justification": "The informal definition explicitly says that \u201c$k$ can be anything,\u201d with $\\binom nk=0$ when $k\\notin\\mathbb N$. The target instead binds only `(k : \u2115)`, and `Ring.choose` itself has signature `R \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 R`; thus the formal language supplied here has no zero-extended binomial coefficient for non-natural lower indices. Consequently the target proves only the natural-index case and cannot express the full blueprint statement under its stated definition. To make it faithful, a dependency defining binomial coefficients on a broader index domain (for example `\u2124`, equal to `Ring.choose` on naturals and `0` otherwise) is needed, and the theorem should quantify over that domain. Alternatively, the informal statement/definition would need to restrict `k` to `\u2115`."
