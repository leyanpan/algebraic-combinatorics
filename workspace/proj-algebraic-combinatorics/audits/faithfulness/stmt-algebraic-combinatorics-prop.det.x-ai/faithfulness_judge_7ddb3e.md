{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → {n : ℕ} → R → (Fin n → R) → Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) R

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.det.x+ai

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $d_1,d_2,\ldots ,d_n\in K$ and $x\in K$. Let $F$ be the $n\times n$-matrix 

\[  \begin{pmatrix}  x+d_1 

&  x 

&  \cdots 

&  x

\\ x 

&  x+d_2 

&  \cdots 

&  x

\\ \vdots 

&  \vdots 

&  \ddots 

&  \vdots 

\\ x 

&  x 

&  \cdots 

&  x+d_n 

\end{pmatrix}\in K^{n\times n}.  \]

 Then, 

\[  \det F = d_1 d_2 \cdots d_n + x \sum _{i=1}^n d_1 d_2 \cdots \widehat{d_i} \cdots d_n,  \]

 where the hat over “$d_i$” means “omit the $d_i$ factor.”

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.det
def.det.det

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. Let $A \in K^{n \times n}$ be an $n \times n$-matrix. The \emph{determinant} $\det A$ of $A$ is defined to be the element 

\[  \sum _{\sigma \in S_n} (-1)^{\sigma } \underbrace{A_{1,\sigma (1)} A_{2,\sigma (2)} \cdots A_{n,\sigma (n)}}_{ = \prod _{i=1}^{n} A_{i,\sigma (i)}}  \]

 of $K$. Here: 

\begin{itemize} \item we let $S_n$ denote the $n$-th symmetric group (i.e., the group of permutations of $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $); 

\item we let $(-1)^{\sigma }$ denote the sign of the permutation $\sigma $ (as defined in Definition~ \ref{def.perm.sign}). 

\end{itemize}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sign
def.perm.sign

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. The \emph{sign} of a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is defined to be the integer $(-1)^{\ell (\sigma )}$. 

It is denoted by $(-1)^{\sigma }$ or $\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )$ or $\operatorname {sign}(\sigma )$ or $\varepsilon (\sigma )$. It is also known as the \emph{signature} of $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target exactly matches the stated matrix and determinant formula. The dependency defines `constPlusDiagMatrix x d` by `fun ... i j => x + if i = j then d i else 0`, so its diagonal entries are `x + d i` and its off-diagonal entries are `x`, as in the displayed matrix `F`. The conclusion `(constPlusDiagMatrix x d).det = \u220f i, d i + x * \u2211 i, \u220f j \u2208 Finset.univ.erase i, d j` is precisely `det F = d\u2081\u22efd\u2099 + x \u2211\u1d62 d\u2081\u22efd\u0302\u1d62\u22efd\u2099`: `Fin n` indexes the `n` entries, and `Finset.univ.erase i` implements omission of the `i`th factor. The binders `\u2200 {R : Type u_1} [CommRing R] {n : \u2115} (x : R) (d : Fin n \u2192 R)` provide the algebraic structure required by the supplied Leibniz determinant and by the sums, products, and signs in the informal definition; they do not add an unrelated hypothesis. The zero-based `Fin n` indexing is merely a reindexing of the informal indices `1,\u2026,n`."
