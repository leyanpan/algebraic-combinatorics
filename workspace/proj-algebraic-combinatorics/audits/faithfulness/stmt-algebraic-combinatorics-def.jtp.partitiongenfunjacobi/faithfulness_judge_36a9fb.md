## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.partitionGenFunJacobi (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing

Body:
∑' (p : (n : ℕ) × n.Partition), PowerSeries.X ^ (2 * p.fst)

Docstring: The partition generating function in JacobiRing with q replaced by q².

This is ∑_{n≥0} p(n) q^{2n} where p(n) is the number of partitions of n.
Equivalently, it's the image of the partition generating function under the
substitution q ↦ q².

This is a key ingredient in proving Jacobi's triple product identity:
  stateGenFun = jacobiRHS' * partitionGenFunJacobi

Note: We define this as a sum over partitions rather than using the product
formula ∏_{k≥1}(1-q^{2k})^{-1} to match the structure of stateGenFun. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing (def)
Type

Body:
PowerSeries (LaurentPolynomial ℤ)

Docstring: The ring (ℤ[z^±])[[q]] for Jacobi's triple product identity.
This is the ring of formal power series in q with coefficients that are
Laurent polynomials in z over ℤ. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF tsum
{α : Type u_4} →
  {β : Type u_5} →
    [AddCommMonoid α] →
      [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Docstring: `∑' i, f i` is the unconditional sum of `f` if it exists, or 0 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∑'[L] i, f i` is the sum of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `0` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional sum exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice, to use the sum
over the support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a` satisfying `HasSum f a`. Similar remarks
apply to more general summation filters.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sigma
{α : Type u} → (α → Type v) → Type (max u v)

Docstring: Dependent pairs, in which the second element's type depends on the value of the first element. The
type `Sigma β` is typically written `Σ a : α, β a` or `(a : α) × β a`.

Although its values are pairs, `Sigma` is sometimes known as the *dependent sum type*, since it is
the type level version of an indexed summation.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.instAddCommMonoid
{R : Type u_1} → [AddCommMonoid R] → AddCommMonoid (PowerSeries R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LaurentPolynomial
(R : Type u_3) → [Semiring R] → Type u_3

Docstring: The semiring of Laurent polynomials with coefficients in the semiring `R`.
We denote it by `R[T;T⁻¹]`.
The ring homomorphism `C : R →+* R[T;T⁻¹]` includes `R` as the constant polynomials. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

Docstring: Topologies on `α` form a complete lattice, with `⊥` the discrete topology
and `⊤` the indiscrete topology. The infimum of a collection of topologies
is the topology generated by all their open sets, while the supremum is the
topology whose open sets are those sets open in every member of the collection.

the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

partial sums over finite subsets converge with respect to the `atTop` filter. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.jtp.partitionGenFunJacobi

\leanhelper  The \emph{partition generating function in JacobiRing} is 

\[  \sum _{\mu \text{ partition}} q^{2|\mu |} = \prod _{k>0}(1-q^{2k})^{-1} \in (\mathbb {Z}[z^{\pm }])[[q]].  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The body faithfully captures only the left-hand expression: `\u2211' (p : (n : \u2115) \u00d7 n.Partition), PowerSeries.X ^ (2 * p.fst)` indexes all partitions `p` of `n` and contributes `q^(2n)` in `JacobiRing = PowerSeries (LaurentPolynomial \u2124)`. However, the informal statement also asserts the equality `\u2211 _{\u03bc partition} q^{2|\u03bc|} = \u220f _{k>0}(1-q^{2k})^{-1}`. The target is merely a definition with the sum as its body and contains no assertion of the product formula, so it does not imply the full blueprint statement. The difference enters in the target body, not through a binder or dependency. To make the formalization faithful, retain this definition and add a theorem identifying `partitionGenFunJacobi` with the indicated infinite product (supplying an appropriate formal-power-series infinite-product definition if needed)."
