{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm.Word n → Prop

Body:
fun {n} w => List.length w = (Equiv.Perm.wordProd w).length

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition (def)
{n : ℕ} → Fin (n - 1) → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} k => if h : n > 0 then Equiv.swap (Fin.castLE ⋯ k.castSucc) (Fin.castLE ⋯ k.succ) else 1

Docstring: The simple transposition `s_k` that swaps `k` and `k+1` in `Fin n`.
For `k : Fin (n-1)`, this swaps positions `k.castSucc` and `k.succ`.

**Note:** This is equivalent to `AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition k` from `Basics.lean`.
See `simpleTransposition_eq_canonical` for the proof of equivalence.

**Recommended:** For new code, prefer `AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition` (the canonical
definition). Use this definition when working with reduced words and Coxeter-style arguments
within this file. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Body:
fun {α} x =>
  List.brecOn x fun x f =>
    (match (motive := (x : List α) → List.below x → ℕ) x with
      | [] => fun x => 0
      | head :: as => fun x => x.1 + 1)
      f

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sub
Type u → Type u

Docstring: The homogeneous version of `HSub`: `a - b : α` where `a b : α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sub.sub
{α : Type u} → [self : Sub α] → α → α → α

Body:
fun α [self : Sub α] => self.1

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`. See `HSub`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

Body:
{ sub := Nat.sub }

Characterization: Natural subtraction truncates: `a - b = 0` whenever `b ≥ a`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.sub
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun x x_1 =>
  Nat.brecOn (motive := fun x => ℕ → ℕ) x_1
    (fun x f x_2 =>
      (match (motive := ℕ → (x : ℕ) → Nat.below (motive := fun x => ℕ → ℕ) x → ℕ) x_2, x with
        | a, 0 => fun x => a
        | a, b.succ => fun x => (x.1 a).pred)
        f)
    x

Docstring: Subtraction of natural numbers, truncated at `0`. Usually used via the `-` operator.

If a result would be less than zero, then the result is zero.

This definition is overridden in both the kernel and the compiler to efficiently evaluate using the
arbitrary-precision arithmetic library. The definition provided here is the logical model.

Examples:
* `5 - 3 = 2`
* `8 - 2 = 6`
* `8 - 8 = 0`
* `8 - 20 = 0`


Characterization: Natural subtraction truncates: `a - b = 0` whenever `b ≥ a`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Body:
fun α => α ≃ α

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Body:
fun {α} s => s.val.card

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.prod
{α : Type u_1} → [Mul α] → [One α] → List α → α

Body:
fun {α} [Mul α] [One α] xs => List.foldr (fun x1 x2 => x1 * x2) 1 xs

Docstring: Composition of equivalences `e₁ : α ≃ β` and `e₂ : β ≃ γ`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instOne
{α : Type u_4} → One (Equiv.Perm α)

Body:
fun {α} => { one := Equiv.refl α }

Characterization: `(1 : Perm α)` is the identity permutation (`Equiv.Perm.coe_one`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.refl
(α : Sort u_1) → α ≃ α

Body:
fun α => { toFun := id, invFun := id, left_inv := ⋯, right_inv := ⋯ }

Docstring: Any type is equivalent to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α → β) → List α → List β

Body:
fun {α} {β} f x =>
  List.brecOn x fun x f_1 =>
    (match (motive := (x : List α) → List.below x → List β) x with
      | [] => fun x => []
      | a :: as => fun x => f a :: x.1)
      f_1

Docstring: Applies a function to each element of the list, returning the resulting list of values.

`O(|l|)`.

Examples:

* `[].map Nat.succ = []`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.length) = [3, 3, 5]`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.reverse) = ["eno", "owt", "eerht"]`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Body:
fun {α} p [DecidablePred p] s => { val := Multiset.filter p s.val, nodup := ⋯ }

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Body:
fun n self => self.1

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike
Sort u_1 → outParam (Sort u_2) → outParam (Sort u_3) → Sort (max (max (max 1 u_1) u_2) u_3)

Docstring: The class `EquivLike E α β` expresses that terms of type `E` have an
injective coercion to bijections between `α` and `β`.

Note that this does not directly extend `FunLike`, nor take `FunLike` as a parameter,
so we can state `coe_injective'` in a nicer way.

This typeclass is used in the definition of the isomorphism (or equivalence) typeclasses,
such as `ZeroEquivClass`, `MulEquivClass`, `MonoidEquivClass`, ....


## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.coe
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (Sort u_3)} → [self : EquivLike E α β] → E → α → β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Body:
fun n m => n.succ.decLe m

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Body:
fun {α} [Fintype α] => Fintype.elems

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SProd.sprod
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : SProd α β γ] → α → β → γ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Body:
fun {α} c [h : Decidable c] t e => Decidable.casesOn h e t

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.swap
{α : Sort u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → α → α → Equiv.Perm α

Body:

leaves other values as is.

        | a, b.succ => fun x => (x.1 a).succ)
        f)

Docstring: Addition of natural numbers, typically used via the `+` operator.

This function is overridden in both the kernel and the compiler to efficiently evaluate using the

This differs from adding `1`, which instead wraps around.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.perm.IsReduced

\leanhelper  A word $w = (k_1, \ldots , k_q)$ is \emph{reduced} if its length $q$ equals $\ell (s_{k_1} \cdots s_{k_q})$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.perm.simple
conv.perm.simple

A \emph{simple transposition} in $S_n$ means one of the $n-1$ transpositions $s_0, s_1, \ldots , s_{n-2}$. We shall occasionally abbreviate “simple transposition” as “simple”.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.si
def.perm.si

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $i \in [n-1]$. Then, the \emph{simple transposition} $s_i$ is defined by 

\[  s_i := t_{i, i+1} \in S_n.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij
def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.word
def.perm.Word

\leanhelper  A \emph{word} (of length $q$) in $S_n$ is a finite sequence $(k_1, k_2, \ldots , k_q)$ where each $k_i \in \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-2\} $ is an index of a simple transposition.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.wordprod
def.perm.wordProd

\leanhelper  The \emph{product} of a word $w = (k_1, \ldots , k_q)$ is the permutation $s_{k_1} s_{k_2} \cdots s_{k_q}$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unclear",
  "discrepancies": [],
  "justification": "The blueprint requires `q equals \u2113(s_{k_1} \u22ef s_{k_q})`, while the formal body asserts `List.length w = (Equiv.Perm.wordProd w).length`, where `Equiv.Perm.length` unfolds to `\u03c3.inversions.card`. The package supplies no INFORMAL DEFINITION of the notation `\u2113`, so it is unavailable whether blueprint permutation length means inversion cardinality. All other supplied components align: `Word n` is a list of indices in `Fin (n - 1)`, and `wordProd` multiplies the corresponding simple transpositions in the stated order. An informal definition of `\u2113` is needed; if it is the number of inversions, the formalization is faithful."
