## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonal_below_finite (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n : ℕ), {k | AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber k < n}.Finite

Docstring: The set of k with pentagonalNumber k < n is finite, since pentagonal numbers grow quadratically. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber (def)
ℤ → ℕ

Body:
fun k => ((3 * k - 1) * k / 2).toNat

Docstring: The k-th pentagonal number, defined as w_k = (3k - 1) * k / 2.
This is always a nonnegative integer for any k ∈ ℤ.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pent-num}) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.toNat
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: Converts an integer into a natural number. Negative numbers are converted to `0`.

Examples:
* `(7 : Int).toNat = 7`
* `(0 : Int).toNat = 0`
* `(-7 : Int).toNat = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHDiv
{α : Type u_1} → [Div α] → HDiv α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDiv
Div ℤ

Docstring: The `Div Int` and `Mod Int` instances use `Int.ediv` and `Int.emod` for compatibility with SMT-LIB and
because mathematical reasoning tends to be easier.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHMul
{α : Type u_1} → [Mul α] → HMul α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instMul
Mul ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.pent.below-finite

\leanhelper  For any $n\in \mathbb {N}$, the set $\{ k\in \mathbb {Z} : w_k < n\} $ is finite.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.pent-num
def.pars.pent-num

For any $k\in \mathbb {Z}$, define a nonnegative integer $w_{k}\in \mathbb {N}$ by 

\[  w_{k}=\frac{\left( 3k-1\right) k}{2}.  \]

 This is called the $k$\emph{-th pentagonal number}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies exactly as required: `\u2200 (n : \u2115)` matches \u201cFor any n \u2208 \u2115\u201d. Since `pentagonalNumber : \u2124 \u2192 \u2115`, the set `{k | pentagonalNumber k < n}` has `k : \u2124`, matching `{ k \u2208 \u2124 : w_k < n }`. Its conclusion `.Finite` is precisely that this set is finite. The dependency defines `pentagonalNumber k` by `((3 * k - 1) * k / 2).toNat`, representing the informal nonnegative integer `w_k = ((3k-1)k)/2`; for integer k this expression is nonnegative and integral, so `toNat` does not alter its intended value. There are no added hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
