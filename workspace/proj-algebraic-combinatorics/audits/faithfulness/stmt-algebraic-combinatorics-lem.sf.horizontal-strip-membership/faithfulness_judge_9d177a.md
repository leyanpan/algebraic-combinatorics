Docstring: Complete characterization of membership in `horizontalNStripPartitions`.

An N-partition λ is in `horizontalNStripPartitions μ n` if and only if:
1. μ ⊆ λ (containment): μ_i ≤ λ_i for all i
2. λ/μ is a horizontal strip: μ_i ≥ λ_{i+1} for all i < N
3. |λ| - |μ| = n (size constraint)
4. Each λ_i is bounded by `horizontalStripUpperBound μ n i`

This characterization is useful for proving that specific partitions
belong to `horizontalNStripPartitions μ n`.

Body:
SymmetricFunctions.NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → (∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i) → SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a list of length N with weakly decreasing nonnegative entries.
This corresponds to Definition def.sf.N-par in the source.

**Note:** This is `SymmetricFunctions.NPartition`, a local definition.
A canonical top-level `NPartition` exists in `NPartition.lean` with the same
semantics (using `antitone` as the field name instead of `weaklyDecreasing`).
See the section docstring for details.

Docstring: The set of N-partitions λ such that λ/μ is a horizontal n-strip.

This is the set of all N-partitions λ satisfying:
1. μ ⊆ λ (containment): μ_i ≤ λ_i for all i
2. Horizontal strip: μ_i ≥ λ_{i+1} for all i < N
3. Size: |λ| - |μ| = n

The set is finite because each λ_i is bounded.

Docstring: The bound for each λ_i when forming a horizontal strip with μ.
λ_i must satisfy μ_i ≤ λ_i ≤ bound_i where:
- For i = 0: bound_0 = μ_0 + n (since |λ| - |μ| = n and all parts are bounded by λ_0)
- For i > 0: bound_i = μ_{i-1} (horizontal strip condition: μ_{i-1} ≥ λ_i)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Iff
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: If and only if, or logical bi-implication. `a ↔ b` means that `a` implies `b` and vice versa.
By `propext`, this implies that `a` and `b` are equal and hence any expression involving `a`
is equivalent to the corresponding expression with `b` instead.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `↔` in identifiers is `iff`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<->` in identifiers is `iff` (prefer `↔` over `<->`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

{n : ℕ} → LE (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.image
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq β] → (α → β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: `image f s` is the forward image of `s` under `f`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd
{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.attach
{α : Type u_1} → (s : Finset α) → Finset { x // x ∈ s }

Docstring: `attach s` takes the elements of `s` and forms a new set of elements of the subtype
`{x // x ∈ s}`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instAddCommMonoid
AddCommMonoid ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable
Prop → Type

Docstring: Either a proof that `p` is true or a proof that `p` is false. This is equivalent to a `Bool` paired
with a proof that the `Bool` is `true` if and only if `p` is true.

`Decidable` instances are primarily used via `if`-expressions and the tactic `decide`. In
conditional expressions, the `Decidable` instance for the proposition is used to select a branch. At
run time, this case distinction code is identical to that which would be generated for a
`Bool`-based conditional. In proofs, the tactic `decide` synthesizes an instance of `Decidable p`,
attempts to reduce it to `isTrue h`, and then succeeds with the proof `h` if it can.

Because `Decidable` carries data, when writing `@[simp]` lemmas which include a `Decidable` instance
on the LHS, it is best to use `{_ : Decidable p}` rather than `[Decidable p]` so that non-canonical
instances can be found via unification rather than instance synthesis.

{n : ℕ} → (a b : Fin n) → Decidable (a ≤ b)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 5 < 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstanceAs
(α : Sort u) → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstanceAs α` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This is just like `inferInstance` except that `α` is given
explicitly instead of being inferred from the target type. It is especially
useful when the target type is some `α'` which is definitionally equal to `α`,
but the instance we are looking for is only registered for `α` (because
typeclass search does not unfold most definitions, but definitional equality
does.) Example:
```
#check inferInstanceAs (Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.piFinset
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → {δ : α → Type u_4} → ((a : α) → Finset (δ a)) → Finset ((a : α) → δ a)

Docstring: Given for all `a : α` a finset `t a` of `δ a`, then one can define the
finset `Fintype.piFinset t` of all functions taking values in `t a` for all `a`. This is the
analogue of `Finset.pi` where the base finset is `univ` (but formally they are not the same, as
there is an additional condition `i ∈ Finset.univ` in the `Finset.pi` definition).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.Icc
{α : Type u_1} → [inst : Preorder α] → [LocallyFiniteOrder α] → α → α → Finset α

Docstring: The finset $[a, b]$ of elements `x` such that `a ≤ x` and `x ≤ b`. Basically `Set.Icc a b` as a
finset. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instPreorder

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instLocallyFiniteOrder

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF decidable_of_iff
{b : Prop} → (a : Prop) → (a ↔ b) → [Decidable a] → Decidable b

Docstring: Transfer decidability of `a` to decidability of `b`, if the propositions are equivalent.
**Important**: this function should be used instead of `rw` on `Decidable b`, because the
kernel will get stuck reducing the usage of `propext` otherwise,
and `decide` will not work.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.horizontal-strip-membership

\leanhelper  An $N$-partition $\lambda $ belongs to $\mathrm{horizontalNStripPartitions}(\mu , n)$ if and only if $\mu \subseteq \lambda $, $\lambda /\mu $ is a horizontal strip, and $|\lambda | - |\mu | = n$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint says membership holds iff \u201c\u03bc \u2286 \u03bb, \u03bb/\u03bc is a horizontal strip, and |\u03bb| - |\u03bc| = n.\u201d These are represented respectively by `\u2200 (i : Fin N), mu.parts i \u2264 lam.parts i`, `isHorizontalStripFun lam.parts mu.parts`, and `hasSizeDiff mu.parts lam.parts n`, whose body is `\u2211 i, lam i = \u2211 i, mu i + n`. The formal RHS additionally requires `\u2200 i, lam.parts i \u2264 horizontalStripUpperBound mu n i`, but this is redundant: for `i > 0` it is exactly implied by the horizontal-strip inequality `lam_i \u2264 mu_{i-1}`, while for `i = 0` it follows from containment of every part together with the total size increase `n`; for `N = 0` it is vacuous. Thus the added conjunct does not narrow the characterized partitions, and the formal and informal statements have the same mathematical content."
