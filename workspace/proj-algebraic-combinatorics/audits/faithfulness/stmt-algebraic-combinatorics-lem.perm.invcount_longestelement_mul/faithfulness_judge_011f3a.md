## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.invCount_longestElement_mul (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.invCount (AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.longestElement n * σ) =
    (AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.nonInv σ).card

Docstring: The inversion count of `w₀ * σ` equals the number of non-inversions of `σ`.

This expresses a fundamental duality: multiplying by the longest element w₀
swaps inversions and non-inversions.


## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.invCount_longestElement_mul' (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.invCount (AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.longestElement n * σ) =
    n.choose 2 - AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.invCount σ

Docstring: The inversion count of `w₀ * σ` equals `n choose 2` minus the inversion count of `σ`.

This shows that multiplication by the longest element w₀ "complements" the length:
if σ has k inversions, then w₀ * σ has (n choose 2) - k inversions.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.invCount (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} σ => (AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.inv σ).card

Docstring: The length (or Coxeter length) of a permutation σ is the number of inversions of σ.
This is denoted ℓ(σ) in the source.

See Definition 1.3.1 (def.perm.invs) part (b) in the source.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.longestElement (def)
(n : ℕ) → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Body:
fun n => { toFun := fun i => ⟨n - 1 - ↑i, ⋯⟩, invFun := fun i => ⟨n - 1 - ↑i, ⋯⟩, left_inv := ⋯, right_inv := ⋯ }

Docstring: The longest element w₀ ∈ S_n is the permutation with OLN n(n-1)(n-2)...21,
i.e., the reversal permutation.

Note: This is equivalent to `Fin.revPerm` from Mathlib. See `longestElement_eq_revPerm`.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.nonInv (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n × Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ => {p | p.1 < p.2 ∧ σ p.1 < σ p.2}

Docstring: The non-inversions of a permutation σ: pairs (i, j) with i < j and σ i < σ j.

This is the complement of `inv σ` within the set of ordered pairs.
The non-inversions are exactly the pairs where σ preserves the order.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.inv (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n × Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ => {p | p.1 < p.2 ∧ σ p.1 > σ p.2}

Docstring: An inversion of a permutation σ ∈ S_n is a pair (i, j) of elements of [n]
such that i < j and σ(i) > σ(j).

See Definition 1.3.1 (def.perm.invs) in the source.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.choose
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Docstring: `choose n k` is the number of `k`-element subsets in an `n`-element set. Also known as binomial
coefficients. For the fact that this is the number of `k`-element-subsets of an `n`-element
set, see `Finset.card_powersetCard`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.invCount_longestElement_mul

\leanhelper  For any $\sigma \in S_n$, the inversions of $w_0 \sigma $ are exactly the non-inversions of $\sigma $, and 

\[  \ell (w_0 \sigma ) = \binom {n}{2} - \ell (\sigma ).  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.noninv
def.perm.nonInv

\leanhelper  The \emph{non-inversions} of a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ are the pairs $(i,j)$ with $i < j$ and $\sigma (i) < \sigma (j)$. These are exactly the ordered pairs that are not inversions. The inversions and non-inversions partition the set of all $\binom {n}{2}$ ordered pairs.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint asserts two conclusions: \u201cthe inversions of $w_0\\sigma$ are exactly the non-inversions of $\\sigma$\u201d and \u201c$\\ell(w_0\\sigma)=\\binom n2-\\ell(\\sigma)$.\u201d The second target faithfully states the numerical conclusion via `invCount (longestElement n * \u03c3) = n.choose 2 - invCount \u03c3`. However, the first target states only a cardinality equality, `invCount (longestElement n * \u03c3) = (nonInv \u03c3).card`. Since `invCount` is defined as `(inv \u03c3).card`, this says the two finite sets have equal cardinality; it does not imply that the inversion set is exactly the non-inversion set. Thus the conjunction of the two targets omits the blueprint\u2019s set-level assertion. To make the package faithful, strengthen or supplement `invCount_longestElement_mul` with `inv (longestElement n * \u03c3) = nonInv \u03c3`; the cardinality theorem can then follow from that equality. The binders `\u2200 {n : \u2115} (\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))` and the multiplication convention introduce no additional restriction beyond the stated Lean convention."
