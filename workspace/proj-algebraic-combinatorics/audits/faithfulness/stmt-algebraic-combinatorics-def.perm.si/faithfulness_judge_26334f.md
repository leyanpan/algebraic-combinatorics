## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition_apply_self (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (i : Fin (n - 1)), (AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition i) ⟨↑i, ⋯⟩ = ⟨↑i + 1, ⋯⟩

Docstring: Simple transposition `s_i` sends `i` to `i+1`. (def.perm.si) 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition_apply_succ (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (i : Fin (n - 1)), (AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition i) ⟨↑i + 1, ⋯⟩ = ⟨↑i, ⋯⟩

Docstring: Simple transposition `s_i` sends `i+1` to `i`. (def.perm.si) 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition_eq_transposition (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (i : Fin (n - 1)),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition i = AlgebraicCombinatorics.transposition ⟨↑i, ⋯⟩ ⟨↑i + 1, ⋯⟩

Docstring: Simple transposition `s_i` equals the transposition `t_{i,i+1}`. (def.perm.si) 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{n : ℕ} → Fin (n - 1) → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn n

Body:
fun {n} i => Equiv.swap ⟨↑i, ⋯⟩ ⟨↑i + 1, ⋯⟩

Docstring: The simple transposition `s_i` swaps `i` and `i+1` in `Fin n`.
Here `i : Fin (n - 1)` ensures `i+1 < n`.
(def.perm.si)

**This is the canonical definition** for simple transpositions in the codebase.

**Equivalent definition in Inversions2.lean:**
`Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition` in `Inversions2.lean` defines the same permutation
using a slightly different construction (with `castSucc`/`succ`). The equivalence is
proven by `Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition_eq_canonical`.

See the equivalence lemmas `simpleTransposition_eq_swap_*` below for other formulations. 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition_apply_of_ne (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (i : Fin (n - 1)) (k : Fin n), ↑k ≠ ↑i → ↑k ≠ ↑i + 1 → (AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition i) k = k

Docstring: Simple transposition `s_i` fixes any `k ≠ i, i+1`. (def.perm.si) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn (def)
ℕ → Type

Body:
fun n => Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Docstring: The n-th symmetric group `S_n` is the group of permutations of `[n]`.
    (def.perm.Sn-iven)

In the textbook, `S_n` is defined as `S_[n]`, the symmetric group of `[n] = {1, 2, ..., n}`.
In Lean, we represent this as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, the group of permutations of
`Fin n = {0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

The size of `S_n` is `n!` (see `sn_card`). 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.transposition (def)
{X : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq X] → X → X → Equiv.Perm X

Body:
fun {X} [DecidableEq X] i j => Equiv.swap i j

Docstring: The transposition swapping `i` and `j`. In Mathlib, this is `Equiv.swap i j`.
(def.perm.tij)

A transposition `t_{i,j}` is the permutation of `X` that:
- sends `i` to `j` (see `transposition_apply_left`)
- sends `j` to `i` (see `transposition_apply_right`)
- leaves all other elements unchanged (see `transposition_apply_of_ne_of_ne`) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le
∀ {n m k : ℕ}, n < m → m ≤ k → n < k

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.isLt
∀ {n : ℕ} (self : Fin n), ↑self < n

Docstring: The number `val` is strictly less than the bound `n`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.sub_le
∀ (n m : ℕ), n - m ≤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 5 < 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.swap
{α : Sort u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → α → α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: `swap a b` is the permutation that swaps `a` and `b` and
leaves other values as is. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.perm.si

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $i \in [n-1]$. Then, the \emph{simple transposition} $s_i$ is defined by 

\[  s_i := t_{i, i+1} \in S_n.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij
def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint states: \u201cLet n \u2208 \u2115 and i \u2208 [n\u22121]\u201d and defines \u201cs_i := t_{i,i+1} \u2208 S_n.\u201d The formal definition quantifies `{n : \u2115}` and `i : Fin (n - 1)`, with body `Equiv.swap \u27e8\u2191i, \u22ef\u27e9 \u27e8\u2191i + 1, \u22ef\u27e9`. Since `AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn n` is `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` and `AlgebraicCombinatorics.transposition` is defined as `Equiv.swap`, this is exactly the transposition of the two adjacent represented elements. The use of `Fin n = {0,\u2026,n\u22121}` instead of the textbook `[n] = {1,\u2026,n}` is the project\u2019s documented zero-based encoding: formal `i.val` represents the textbook index `i+1`, so the adjacent pair is preserved under the shift. The theorem `simpleTransposition_eq_transposition` explicitly gives the defining equality, while the two application lemmas and `simpleTransposition_apply_of_ne` correctly record that the endpoints are exchanged and every other element is fixed. Natural subtraction causes no mismatch at `n = 0` or `n = 1`, because both the informal index set `[n\u22121]` and the formal type `Fin (n\u22121)` are empty there."
