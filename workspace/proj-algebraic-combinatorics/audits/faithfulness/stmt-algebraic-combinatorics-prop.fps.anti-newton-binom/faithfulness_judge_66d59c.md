## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.fps_onePlusX_pow_neg (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {F : Type u_2} [inst : Field F] [BinomialRing F] (n : ℕ),
  (1 + PowerSeries.X)⁻¹ ^ n = PowerSeries.mk fun k => (-1) ^ k * ↑(Ring.choose (↑n + ↑k - 1) k)

Docstring: **Proposition (prop.fps.anti-newton-binom)**: For each `n ∈ ℕ`, we have
`(1+x)^{-n} = Σ_{k ∈ ℕ} (-1)^k * C(n+k-1, k) * x^k`.

Note: We express this using the inverse since PowerSeries over a general ring
doesn't have integer power operations.
Label: prop.fps.anti-newton-binom 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Field
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A `Field` is a `CommRing` with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.

An instance of `Field K` includes maps `ratCast : ℚ → K` and `qsmul : ℚ → K → K`.
Those two fields are needed to implement the `DivisionRing K → Algebra ℚ K` instance since we need
to control the specific definitions for some special cases of `K` (in particular `K = ℚ` itself).
See also note [forgetful inheritance].

If the field has positive characteristic `p`, our division by zero convention forces
`ratCast (1 / p) = 1 / 0 = 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF BinomialRing
(R : Type u_1) → [AddCommMonoid R] → [Pow R ℕ] → Type u_1

Docstring: A binomial ring is a ring for which ascending Pochhammer evaluations are uniquely divisible by
suitable factorials. We define this notion as a mixin for additive commutative monoids with natural
number powers, but retain the ring name. We introduce `Ring.multichoose` as the uniquely defined
quotient.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HPow.hPow
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HPow α β γ] → α → β → γ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.cast
{R : Type u} → [IntCast R] → ℤ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Int → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a ring structure,
and this homomorphism should be a ring homomorphism.

`IntCast` and `NatCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`IntCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus an
`IntCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive group with a `1`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ring.choose
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : AddCommGroupWithOne R] → [inst_1 : Pow R ℕ] → [BinomialRing R] → R → ℕ → R

Docstring: The binomial coefficient `choose r n` generalizes the natural number `Nat.choose` function,
interpreted in terms of choosing without replacement. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.fps.anti-newton-binom

For each $n\in \mathbb {N}$, we have

\[  \left(1+x\right)^{-n}=\sum _{k\in \mathbb {N}}\left(-1\right)^{k}\binom {n+k-1}{k}x^{k}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.commring.fracs
def.commring.fracs

Let $L$ be a commutative ring. Let $a\in L$. Assume that $a$ is invertible. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} The inverse of $a$ is called $a^{-1}$. 

\textbf{(b)} For any $b\in L$, the product $b\cdot a^{-1}$ is called $\frac{b}{a}$ (or $b/a$). 

\textbf{(c)} For any negative integer $n$, we define $a^{n}$ to be $\left( a^{-1}\right)^{-n}$. Thus, the $n$-th power $a^{n}$ is defined for each $n\in \mathbb {Z}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.commring.inverse-2
def.commring.inverse

Let $L$ be a commutative ring. Let $a\in L$. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inverse} (or \emph{multiplicative inverse}) of $a$ means an element $b\in L$ such that $ab=ba=1$. 

\textbf{(b)} We say that $a$ is \emph{invertible} in $L$ (or a \emph{unit} of $L$) if $a$ has an inverse.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint states only \u201cFor each $n\\in\\mathbb N$\u201d and presents the formal-power-series identity in the commutative-ring setting supplied by `def.alg.commring`; it does not require the coefficient ring to be a field or a binomial ring. The elaborated target instead quantifies `\u2200 {F : Type u_2} [inst : Field F] [BinomialRing F] (n : \u2115), ...`, thereby restricting the identity to fields carrying a `BinomialRing` instance. These are mathematically contentful added hypotheses, especially since the coefficient on the right is already computed as `Ring.choose` in `\u2124` and then cast to `F`, so `[BinomialRing F]` is not justified by the displayed formula. The inverse-power interpretation itself is faithful: `(1 + PowerSeries.X)\u207b\u00b9 ^ n` represents `(1+x)^{-n}`. To make the declaration faithful, replace the `Field F`/`BinomialRing F` binders by the intended commutative-ring setting and use or define the inverse of the unit `1 + PowerSeries.X` over an arbitrary commutative ring (for example via its explicit geometric-series inverse); then state its `n`th power with the same integer binomial coefficients."
