## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.derivative_X_pow_succ (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommSemiring R] (n : ℕ),
  (PowerSeries.derivative R) (PowerSeries.X ^ (n + 1)) = (↑n + 1) • PowerSeries.X ^ n

Docstring: The derivative of X^(n+1) is (n+1) * X^n. This is a convenient form for induction. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommSemiring
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative semiring is a semiring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Derivation

  (A : Type u_2) →
    (M : Type u_3) →
      [inst : CommSemiring R] →
        [inst_1 : CommSemiring A] →
          [inst_2 : AddCommMonoid M] → [Algebra R A] → [_root_.Module A M] → [_root_.Module R M] → Type (max u_2 u_3)

Docstring: `D : Derivation R A M` is an `R`-linear map from `A` to `M` that satisfies the `leibniz`
equality. We also require that `D 1 = 0`. See `Derivation.mk'` for a constructor that deduces this
assumption from the Leibniz rule when `M` is cancellative.

TODO: update this when bimodules are defined.

The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `^` in identifiers is `pow`.

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies over every natural number: \u201cFor any $n\\in\\mathbb N$,\u201d and the target has exactly `(n : \u2115)`. Its equation `(PowerSeries.derivative R) (PowerSeries.X ^ (n + 1)) = (\u2191n + 1) \u2022 PowerSeries.X ^ n` states that the formal derivative of $X^{n+1}$ is the scalar $(n+1)$ times $X^n`, matching \u201c$(x^{n+1})'=(n+1)\\cdot x^n$.\u201d The binder `{R : Type u_1} [CommSemiring R]` supplies the coefficient setting needed for formal power series and their derivative; the informal statement does not fix a coefficient ring, and the formal theorem uniformly covers every commutative semiring."
