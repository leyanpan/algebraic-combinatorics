Docstring: **Finite Product Rule for Infinite Sums** (discrete case, general finite index set)

This is `prop.fps.prodrule-fin-infJ` for discrete topology, fully proved.

For a finite product of summable families over any finite type N:
`∏_{i ∈ N} (∑_{k ∈ S_i} p_{i,k}) = ∑_{f : N → S} ∏_{i ∈ N} p_{i,f(i)}`

This version uses `prod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_finset_discrete` and reindexes via `Fintype.equivFin`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF TopologicalSpace
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A topology on `X`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF IsTopologicalRing
(R : Type u_1) → [TopologicalSpace R] → [NonUnitalNonAssocRing R] → Prop

Docstring: A topological ring is a ring `R` where addition, multiplication and negation are continuous.

If `R` is a (unital) ring, then continuity of negation can be derived from continuity of
multiplication as it is multiplication with `-1`. (See
`IsTopologicalSemiring.continuousNeg_of_mul` and
`topological_semiring.to_topological_add_group`)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF T2Space
(X : Type u) → [TopologicalSpace X] → Prop

Docstring: A T₂ space, also known as a Hausdorff space, is one in which for every
`x ≠ y` there exists disjoint open sets around `x` and `y`. This is
the most widely used of the separation axioms. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DiscreteTopology
(α : Type u_2) → [t : TopologicalSpace α] → Prop

Docstring: A topological space is discrete if every set is open, that is,
its topology equals the discrete topology `⊥`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Summable

  {β : Type u_2} →
    [AddCommMonoid α] →
      [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → Prop

Docstring: `Summable f` means that `f` has some (infinite) sum with respect to `L`. Use `tsum` to get the
value.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.WithPiTopology.instTopologicalSpace
(R : Type u_1) → [TopologicalSpace R] → TopologicalSpace (PowerSeries R)

Docstring: The pointwise topology on `PowerSeries` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SummationFilter.unconditional
(β : Type u_2) → SummationFilter β

Docstring: **Unconditional summation**: a function on `β` is said to be *unconditionally summable* if its
partial sums over finite subsets converge with respect to the `atTop` filter. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommMonoid
{α : Type u} → [self : CommRing α] → CommMonoid α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.instCommRing
{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → CommRing (PowerSeries R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF tsum
{α : Type u_4} →
  {β : Type u_5} →
    [AddCommMonoid α] →
      [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Docstring: `∑' i, f i` is the unconditional sum of `f` if it exists, or 0 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∑'[L] i, f i` is the sum of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `0` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional sum exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice, to use the sum
over the support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a` satisfying `HasSum f a`. Similar remarks
apply to more general summation filters.)


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.fps.prodrule-fin-infJ

Let $N$ be a finite set. For any $i\in N$, let $\left( p_{i,k}\right) _{k\in S_{i}}$ be a summable family of elements of $K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $. Then,

\begin{equation}  \prod _{i\in N}\  \  \sum _{k\in S_{i}}p_{i,k}=\sum _{\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in N}\in \prod _{i\in N}S_{i}}\  \  \prod _{i\in N}p_{i,k_{i}}. \end{equation}

 In particular, the family $\left( \prod _{i\in N}p_{i,k_{i}}\right) _{\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in N}\in \prod _{i\in N}S_{i}}$ is summable.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint concludes both the product-rule equality and: \u201cIn particular, the family \u2026 is summable.\u201d The target\u2019s conclusion is only `\u220f i, \u2211' (k : S i), p i k = \u2211' (f : (i : N) \u2192 S i), \u220f i, p i (f i)`; it contains no conclusion `Summable (fun f : (i : N) \u2192 S i => \u220f i, p i (f i))`. Merely writing the right-hand `tsum` does not assert summability, since `tsum` is defined even for nonsummable families. The discrete pointwise topology is an appropriate encoding of the blueprint\u2019s entrywise-essentially-finite notion, and `[Fintype N]` represents finite `N`; the decisive drift is the weakened conclusion in the target declaration. To be faithful, replace the conclusion by the conjunction of the displayed equality and `Summable (fun f : (i : N) \u2192 S i => \u220f i, p i (f i))` (or otherwise include both assertions in the declaration)."
