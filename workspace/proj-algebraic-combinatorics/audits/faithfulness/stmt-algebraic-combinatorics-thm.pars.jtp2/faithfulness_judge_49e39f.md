Docstring: **Jacobi's Triple Product Identity** (Theorem \ref{thm.pars.jtp2})

The evaluated form of Jacobi's triple product identity:
  jacobiLHSEval a b u v = jacobiRHSEval a b u v

where the LHS is an infinite product and the RHS is an infinite sum.
This is the parameterized version with parameters `a`, `b` (integers with a > 0 and |b| ≤ a)
and `u`, `v` (rational numbers with v ≠ 0).

The proof follows Borcherds' approach via "states" (as presented in Cameron's book, §8.3).
Both sides, when multiplied by the partition generating function, equal the same
"state generating function", allowing cancellation.

See also `jacobi_triple_product_fps'` for the formal power series version (thm.pars.jtp1).

    (1 + coeff1 • PowerSeries.X ^ exp1) * (1 + coeff2 • PowerSeries.X ^ exp2) * (1 - coeff3 • PowerSeries.X ^ exp3)

Docstring: The left-hand side of Jacobi's triple product identity evaluated at q = u·x^a, z = v·x^b:
  ∏_{n>0} ((1 + q^{2n-1}z)(1 + q^{2n-1}z^{-1})(1 - q^{2n}))

Expanding with q = u·x^a and z = v·x^b:
  ∏_{n>0} ((1 + u^{2n-1}v·x^{(2n-1)a+b})(1 + u^{2n-1}v^{-1}·x^{(2n-1)a-b})(1 - u^{2n}·x^{2na}))

When a > 0 and a ≥ |b|, all exponents (2n-1)a+b, (2n-1)a-b, and 2na are nonnegative
for n > 0, so this is a well-defined element of ℚ⟦X⟧.
The infinite product is multipliable because the exponents grow linearly in n.

Body:
fun a b u v => ∑' (ℓ : ℤ), (u ^ (ℓ ^ 2).natAbs * v ^ ℓ) • PowerSeries.X ^ (a * ℓ ^ 2 + b * ℓ).toNat

Docstring: The right-hand side of Jacobi's triple product identity evaluated at q = u·x^a, z = v·x^b:
  ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} q^{ℓ²} z^ℓ = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} u^{ℓ²} v^ℓ x^{aℓ² + bℓ}

When a > 0 and a ≥ |b|, the exponent aℓ² + bℓ ≥ 0 for all ℓ ∈ ℤ, since:
  aℓ² + bℓ ≥ |b|·ℓ² - |b|·|ℓ| = |b|·|ℓ|·(|ℓ| - 1) ≥ 0

This is a well-defined element of ℚ⟦X⟧.
The infinite sum is summable because the exponent aℓ² + bℓ grows quadratically in |ℓ|.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instLTInt

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAddGroup

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Rat

Docstring: Rational numbers, implemented as a pair of integers `num / den` such that the
denominator is positive and the numerator and denominator are coprime.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Rat.instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℚ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF tprod

  {β : Type u_5} →
    [CommMonoid α] → [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Docstring: `∏' i, f i` is the unconditional product of `f`, if it exists, or 1 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∏'[L] i, f i` is the product of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `1` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional product exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the multiplicative support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice,
to use the product over the multiplicative support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a`
satisfying `HasProd f a`. Similar remarks apply to more general summation filters.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

Docstring: Topologies on `α` form a complete lattice, with `⊥` the discrete topology
and `⊤` the indiscrete topology. The infimum of a collection of topologies
is the topology generated by all their open sets, while the supremum is the
topology whose open sets are those sets open in every member of the collection.

The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

(Note that even if the unconditional sum exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not

over the support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a` satisfying `HasSum f a`. Similar remarks

In this section, we will mostly be using FPSs in the indeterminate $q$. That is, we call the indeterminate $q$ rather than $x$. The ring of FPSs in the indeterminate $q$ over a commutative ring $K$ will be denoted by $K[[q]]$. The ring of polynomials in the indeterminate $q$ over $K$ will be denoted by $K[q]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.module

Let $K$ be a commutative ring. 

A $K$\emph{-module} means a set $M$ equipped with three maps 

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \ominus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times M\rightarrow M \end{align*}

 (notice that the third map has domain $K\times M$, not $M\times M$) and an element $\overrightarrow {0}\in M$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in M$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of scaling:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) =\left( uv\right) \rightharpoonup a$ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left distributivity:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( a\oplus b\right) =\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( u\rightharpoonup b\right) $ for all $u\in K$ and $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right distributivity:} We have $\left( u+v\right) \rightharpoonup a=\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) $ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $1\rightharpoonup a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left annihilation:} We have $0\rightharpoonup a=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right annihilation:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $u\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{scaling} (or the $K$\emph{-action}) of the $K$-module $M$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\rightharpoonup b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The element $\overrightarrow {0}$ is called the \emph{zero} (or the \emph{zero vector}) of the $K$-module $M$. We will usually just call it $0$. 

When $M$ is a $K$-module, the elements of $M$ are called \emph{vectors}, while the elements of $K$ are called \emph{scalars}. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $, with the operation $\rightharpoonup $ having higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $.

Let $L$ be a commutative ring. Let $a\in L$. Assume that $a$ is invertible. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} The inverse of $a$ is called $a^{-1}$. 

\textbf{(b)} For any $b\in L$, the product $b\cdot a^{-1}$ is called $\frac{b}{a}$ (or $b/a$). 

\textbf{(c)} For any negative integer $n$, we define $a^{n}$ to be $\left( a^{-1}\right)^{-n}$. Thus, the $n$-th power $a^{n}$ is defined for each $n\in \mathbb {Z}$.

Let $L$ be a commutative ring. Let $a\in L$. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inverse} (or \emph{multiplicative inverse}) of $a$ means an element $b\in L$ such that $ab=ba=1$. 

\textbf{(b)} We say that $a$ is \emph{invertible} in $L$ (or a \emph{unit} of $L$) if $a$ has an inverse.

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

Let $K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $ be the $K$-module $K^{\mathbb {Z}}$ of all families $\left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}=\left( \ldots ,a_{-2},a_{-1},a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) $ of elements of $K$. Its addition and its scaling are defined entrywise:

\begin{align*}  \left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}+\left( b_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}} &  =\left( a_{n}+b_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}};\\ \lambda \left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}} &  =\left( \lambda a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }\lambda \in K. \end{align*}

 An element of $K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $ will be called a \emph{doubly infinite power series}. We use the notation $\sum _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}a_{n}x^{n}$ for a family $\left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}\in K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.laure.laupol

Let $K\left[ x^{\pm }\right] $ be the $K$-submodule of $K\left[ \left[ x^{\pm }\right] \right] $ consisting of all \textbf{essentially finite} families $\left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}$. The elements of $K\left[ x^{\pm }\right] $ are called \emph{Laurent polynomials} in the indeterminate $x$ over $K$. 

We define a multiplication on $K\left[ x^{\pm }\right] $ by setting

\[  \left( a_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}\cdot \left( b_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}}=\left( c_{n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {Z}},\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{where}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  c_{n}=\sum _{i\in \mathbb {Z}}a_{i}b_{n-i}.  \]

 The sum $\sum _{i\in \mathbb {Z}}a_{i}b_{n-i}$ is well-defined because it is essentially finite. 

We define an element $x\in K\left[ x^{\pm }\right] $ by

\[  x=\left( \delta _{i,1}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {Z}}.  \]

In Mathlib, Laurent polynomials are represented as finitely supported functions $\mathbb {Z} \to K$ (the group algebra of $\mathbb {Z}$ over $K$).

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip

\textbf{(b)} We let $K\left[ x\right] $ be the set of all polynomials $a\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $. This set $K\left[ x\right] $ is a subring of $K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $ (according to Theorem \ref{thm.fps.pol.ring} below), and is called the \emph{univariate polynomial ring} over $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

\[  \text{each }m\in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots ,n\right\} \text{ satisfies } \left[x^{m}\right]f=\left[x^{m}\right]g.  \]

Thus, we have defined a binary relation $\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }$ on the set $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$. We say that an FPS $f$ is $x^{n}$\emph{-equivalent} to an FPS $g$ if and only if $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$.

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

Let u,v\u2208\u211a ... with v\u22600.\u201d The dependency bodies correctly expand the stated substitution `q = ux^a`, `z = vx^b`: `jacobiLHSEval` indexes `n>0` by `n := k+1` and uses coefficients and exponents `u^(2n-1)v\u00b7x^((2n-1)a+b)`, `u^(2n-1)v\u207b\u00b9\u00b7x^((2n-1)a-b)`, and `u^(2n)\u00b7x^(2na)`; `jacobiRHSEval` uses `(u ^ (\u2113 ^ 2).natAbs * v ^ \u2113) \u2022 X ^ (a * \u2113 ^ 2 + b * \u2113).toNat`. Under `a > 0` and `a \u2265 |b|`, all these integer exponents are nonnegative, so the uses of `.toNat` do not truncate negative exponents; `(\u2113^2).natAbs` likewise represents the nonnegative exponent \u2113\u00b2. Thus the target equality `jacobiLHSEval ... = jacobiRHSEval ...` is precisely the displayed product\u2013sum identity in `PowerSeries \u211a`, with no added mathematical hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
