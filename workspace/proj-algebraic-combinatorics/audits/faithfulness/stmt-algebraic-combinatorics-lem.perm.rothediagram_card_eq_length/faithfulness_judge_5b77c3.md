## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.inversions (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n × Fin n)

Docstring: The set of inversions of a permutation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instFintypeProd
(α : Type u_4) → (β : Type u_5) → [Fintype α] → [Fintype β] → Fintype (α × β)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Inv.inv
{α : Type u} → [self : Inv α] → α → α

Docstring: `a⁻¹` computes the inverse of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `⁻¹` in identifiers is `inv`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instInv
{α : Type u_4} → Inv (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable
Prop → Type

Docstring: Either a proof that `p` is true or a proof that `p` is false. This is equivalent to a `Bool` paired
with a proof that the `Bool` is `true` if and only if `p` is true.

`Decidable` instances are primarily used via `if`-expressions and the tactic `decide`. In
conditional expressions, the `Decidable` instance for the proposition is used to select a branch. At
run time, this case distinction code is identical to that which would be generated for a
`Bool`-based conditional. In proofs, the tactic `decide` synthesizes an instance of `Decidable p`,
attempts to reduce it to `isTrue h`, and then succeeds with the proof `h` if it can.

Because `Decidable` carries data, when writing `@[simp]` lemmas which include a `Decidable` instance
on the LHS, it is best to use `{_ : Decidable p}` rather than `[Decidable p]` so that non-canonical
instances can be found via unification rather than instance synthesis.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstanceAs
(α : Sort u) → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstanceAs α` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This is just like `inferInstance` except that `α` is given
explicitly instead of being inferred from the target type. It is especially
useful when the target type is some `α'` which is definitionally equal to `α`,
but the instance we are looking for is only registered for `α` (because
typeclass search does not unfold most definitions, but definitional equality
does.) Example:
```
#check inferInstanceAs (Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd
{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.decLt
{n : ℕ} → (a b : Fin n) → Decidable (a < b)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.rotheDiagram_card_eq_length

\leanhelper  The number of cells in the Rothe diagram of $\sigma $ equals $\ell (\sigma )$. The bijection sends $(i, j)$ in the Rothe diagram to the inversion $(i, \sigma ^{-1}(j))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.inrothediagram
def.perm.inRotheDiagram

\leanhelper  A cell $(i, j)$ is in the \emph{Rothe diagram} of $\sigma $ if $j < \sigma (i)$ and $i < \sigma ^{-1}(j)$. These are the cells that are not “hit” by either the row or column of a permutation matrix entry.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies over exactly the relevant finite permutations, `\u2200 {n : \u2115} (\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))`, corresponding to `\u03c3 \u2208 S_n`. Its left side counts all pairs satisfying `\u03c3.inRotheDiagram p.1 p.2`, whose body is exactly `j < \u03c3 i \u2227 i < \u03c3\u207b\u00b9 j`, matching the informal definition \u201cif `j < \u03c3(i)` and `i < \u03c3\u207b\u00b9(j)`.\u201d Its right side is `\u03c3.length`, defined as `\u03c3.inversions.card`, with inversions defined by `p.1 < p.2 \u2227 \u03c3 p.2 < \u03c3 p.1`, exactly the informal condition `i < j` and `\u03c3(i) > \u03c3(j)`. Thus the equality states that the number of Rothe-diagram cells equals `\u2113(\u03c3)`. Using `Fin n` rather than `[n] = {1,\u2026,n}` is only the standard order-preserving reindexing of the same finite ordered set and does not alter the cardinality claim. The sentence describing the bijection is explanatory proof information, not an additional conclusion absent from the target."
