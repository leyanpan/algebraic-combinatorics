Docstring: Simple transposition s_k swaps positions k and k+1.

This is an alias for the canonical definition `AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition`
from `Permutations/Basics.lean`. The canonical definition uses `Fin (N - 1)` to encode
the constraint that k + 1 < N.

{n : ℕ} → Fin (n - 1) → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn n

Body:
fun {n} i => Equiv.swap ⟨↑i, ⋯⟩ ⟨↑i + 1, ⋯⟩

Docstring: The simple transposition `s_i` swaps `i` and `i+1` in `Fin n`.
Here `i : Fin (n - 1)` ensures `i+1 < n`.
(def.perm.si)

**This is the canonical definition** for simple transpositions in the codebase.

**Equivalent definition in Inversions2.lean:**
`Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition` in `Inversions2.lean` defines the same permutation
using a slightly different construction (with `castSucc`/`succ`). The equivalence is
proven by `Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition_eq_canonical`.

See the equivalence lemmas `simpleTransposition_eq_swap_*` below for other formulations. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn (def)
ℕ → Type

Body:
fun n => Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Docstring: The n-th symmetric group `S_n` is the group of permutations of `[n]`.
    (def.perm.Sn-iven)

In the textbook, `S_n` is defined as `S_[n]`, the symmetric group of `[n] = {1, 2, ..., n}`.
In Lean, we represent this as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, the group of permutations of
`Fin n = {0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

The size of `S_n` is `n!` (see `sn_card`). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Iff
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: If and only if, or logical bi-implication. `a ↔ b` means that `a` implies `b` and vice versa.
By `propext`, this implies that `a` and `b` are equal and hence any expression involving `a`
is equivalent to the corresponding expression with `b` instead.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `↔` in identifiers is `iff`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<->` in identifiers is `iff` (prefer `↔` over `<->`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.simples-enough

For each $i \in [N-1]$, let $s_i \in S_N$ denote the simple transposition that swaps $i$ and $i+1$. 

Let $f \in \mathcal{P}$. Assume that 

\begin{equation}  s_k \cdot f = f \quad \text{for each } k \in [N-1].  \end{equation}

 Then, the polynomial $f$ is symmetric.

Fix a commutative ring $K$. Fix an $N\in \mathbb {N}$. Throughout this chapter, we will keep $K$ and $N$ fixed. Let $S_N$ denote the symmetric group, i.e., the group of all permutations of $[N] := \{ 1,2,\ldots ,N\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.si
def.perm.si

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $i \in [n-1]$. Then, the \emph{simple transposition} $s_i$ is defined by 

\[  s_i := t_{i, i+1} \in S_n.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij
def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ps
def.sf.PS

\textbf{(a)} Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the polynomial ring $K[x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N]$ in $N$ variables over $K$. This is not just a ring; it is a commutative $K$-algebra. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The symmetric group $S_N$ acts on the set $\mathcal{P}$ according to the formula 

\[  \sigma \cdot f = f[x_{\sigma (1)}, x_{\sigma (2)}, \ldots , x_{\sigma (N)}] \quad \text{for any } \sigma \in S_N \text{ and any } f \in \mathcal{P}.  \]

 Here, $f[a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N]$ means the result of substituting $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N$ for the indeterminates $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N$ in a polynomial $f \in \mathcal{P}$. 

Roughly speaking, the group $S_N$ is thus acting on $\mathcal{P}$ by permuting variables: A permutation $\sigma \in S_N$ transforms a polynomial $f$ by substituting $x_{\sigma (i)}$ for each $x_i$. 

Note that this action of $S_N$ on $\mathcal{P}$ is a well-defined group action (as we will see in Proposition~ \ref{prop.sf.SN-acts} below). \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} A polynomial $f \in \mathcal{P}$ is said to be \emph{symmetric} if it satisfies 

\[  \sigma \cdot f = f \quad \text{for all } \sigma \in S_N.  \]

\textbf{(d)} We let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all symmetric polynomials $f \in \mathcal{P}$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint assumes \u201cs_k \u00b7 f = f for each k \u2208 [N-1]\u201d and concludes \u201cthe polynomial f is symmetric.\u201d The formal theorem states the stronger equivalence `IsSymm f \u2194 \u2200 (k : Fin (N - 1)), permAction (simpleTransposition k) f = f`, whose reverse implication is exactly the blueprint claim. Here `P K N = MvPolynomial (Fin N) K`, `IsSymm f = MvPolynomial.IsSymmetric f`, `permAction \u03c3 f = MvPolynomial.rename \u21d1\u03c3 f`, and `simpleTransposition k` swaps the adjacent positions represented by `k` and `k+1`. The use of `Fin N` rather than the one-based set `[N]` is the documented zero-based representation, and `Fin (N - 1)` correctly encodes the allowed adjacent transpositions. The additional converse makes the Lean theorem stronger, not weaker, so it remains faithful."
