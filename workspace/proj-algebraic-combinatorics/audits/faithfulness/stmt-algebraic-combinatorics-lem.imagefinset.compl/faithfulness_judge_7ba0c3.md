## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.imageFinset_compl (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (P : Finset (Fin n)),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.imageFinset σ Pᶜ = (AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.imageFinset σ P)ᶜ

Docstring: The image of a complement equals the complement of the image.
See also `PermFinset.imageFinset_compl`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.imageFinset (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ P => Finset.map { toFun := ⇑σ, inj' := ⋯ } P

Docstring: The image of a finset under a permutation.

This is definitionally equal to `PermFinset.imageFinset` (see `imageFinset_eq_permFinset`).
New code should prefer `PermFinset.imageFinset`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α ↪ β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.imageFinset.compl

\leanhelper  For a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ and a subset $P\subseteq [n]$, $\sigma (\overline{P}) = \overline{\sigma (P)}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.imagefinset
def.det.imageFinset

\leanhelper  The \emph{image} of a finite subset $P \subseteq [n]$ under a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is $\sigma (P) = \{ \sigma (i) \mid i \in P\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies over exactly the relevant data, `\u2200 {n : \u2115} (\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (P : Finset (Fin n))`, and asserts `imageFinset \u03c3 P\u1d9c = (imageFinset \u03c3 P)\u1d9c`. By the dependency body, `imageFinset \u03c3 P` is `Finset.map` under the bijection `\u03c3`, hence is precisely the informal image `{\u03c3(i) | i \u2208 P}`. The `Finset` complement is taken in the finite ambient type `Fin n`, matching complement inside `[n]`. Thus the equality is exactly \u201c\u03c3(\\overline P) = \\overline{\u03c3(P)}.\u201d Although the informal convention defines `[n]` for integer `n` while Lean uses `n : \u2115` and represents the n-element set as `Fin n` rather than `{1,\u2026,n}`, this causes no mathematical loss: positive cases differ only by relabeling, and every nonpositive informal `[n]` is empty and is represented by `Fin 0`."
