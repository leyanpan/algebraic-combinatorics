## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.CycleDecomposition.sign_cycle (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), σ.IsCycle → Equiv.Perm.sign σ = (-1) ^ (σ.support.card - 1)

Docstring: The sign of a k-cycle is `(-1)^(k-1)`.
Note: Mathlib's `IsCycle.sign` gives `sign σ = -(-1)^(support.card)` which equals
`(-1)^(support.card - 1)` since `-(-1)^n = (-1)^(n-1)` for n ≥ 1. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.IsCycle
{α : Type u_2} → Equiv.Perm α → Prop

Docstring: A cycle is a non-identity permutation where any two nonfixed points of the permutation are
related by repeated application of the permutation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Units
(α : Type u) → [Monoid α] → Type u

Docstring: Units of a `Monoid`, bundled version. Notation: `αˣ`.

An element of a `Monoid` is a unit if it has a two-sided inverse.
This version bundles the inverse element so that it can be computed.
For a predicate see `IsUnit`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MonoidHom

`MonoidHom` is used for both monoid and group homomorphisms.

When possible, instead of parametrizing results over `(f : M →* N)`,
you should parametrize over `(F : Type*) [MonoidHomClass F M N] (f : F)`.

When you extend this structure, make sure to extend `MonoidHomClass`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instUnitsPow

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sign_cycle

\leanhelper  Let $\sigma \in S_n$ be a $k$-cycle (i.e., $\sigma $ is a cycle and moves exactly $k$ elements). Then $(-1)^{\sigma } = (-1)^{k-1}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.dcdlisttoperm
def.dcdListToPerm

\leanhelper  Given a list of lists (each representing a cycle), the corresponding permutation is obtained by composing the cycle permutations $\operatorname {cyc}_{a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m}$ for each list $(a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m)$ in the input.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs
def.perm.cycs

Let $X$ be a set. Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k$ be $k$ distinct elements of $X$. Then, 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}  \]

 means the permutation of $X$ that sends 

\begin{align*} & i_1 \text{ to } i_2, \\ & i_2 \text{ to } i_3, \\ & \ldots , \\ & i_{k-1} \text{ to } i_k, \\ & i_k \text{ to } i_1 \end{align*}

 and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged. In other words, $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}$ means the permutation of $X$ that satisfies 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, \ldots , i_k}(p) = \begin{cases}  i_{j+1}, &  \text{if } p = i_j \text{ for some } j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} ;\\ p, &  \text{otherwise} \end{cases}  \]

 for every $p \in X$, where $i_{k+1}$ means $i_1$. 

This permutation is called a $k$\emph{-cycle}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs.cycs
def.perm.cycs.cycs

Let $X$ be a finite set. Let $\sigma $ be a permutation of $X$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{cycles} of $\sigma $ are defined to be the cycles in the DCD of $\sigma $ (as defined in Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} \textbf{(a)}). (This includes $1$-cycles, if there are any in the DCD of $\sigma $.) 

We shall equate a cycle of $\sigma $ with any of its cyclic rotations; thus, for example, $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 1,4,3\right) $ shall be regarded as being the same cycle (but $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 3,4,1\right) $ shall not). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{cycle lengths partition} of $\sigma $ shall denote the partition of $\left\vert X\right\vert $ obtained by writing down the lengths of the cycles of $\sigma $ in weakly decreasing order.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sign
def.perm.sign

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. The \emph{sign} of a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is defined to be the integer $(-1)^{\ell (\sigma )}$. 

It is denoted by $(-1)^{\sigma }$ or $\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )$ or $\operatorname {sign}(\sigma )$ or $\varepsilon (\sigma )$. It is also known as the \emph{signature} of $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The elaborated target assumes `\u03c3.IsCycle`, while the base-library definition says this is \u201ca cycle [that] is a non-identity permutation.\u201d The blueprint\u2019s definition of `cyc_{i\u2081,\u2026,i\u2096}` allows `k = 1`; then `cyc_{i\u2081}` is the identity permutation, and the supplied definition of cycles explicitly says that \u201cThis includes `1`-cycles.\u201d Thus the formal hypothesis excludes the blueprint\u2019s 1-cycle case, making the theorem weaker. The support-cardinality formulation otherwise directly supplies `k`: for a nontrivial k-cycle, `\u03c3.support.card = k`, and the unit-valued `Equiv.Perm.sign` represents the same \u00b11 integer sign. To be faithful, the hypothesis should use a cycle predicate matching the blueprint, or at least admit the identity case, for example `\u03c3.IsCycle \u2228 \u03c3 = 1` (possibly with a separate identity case)."
