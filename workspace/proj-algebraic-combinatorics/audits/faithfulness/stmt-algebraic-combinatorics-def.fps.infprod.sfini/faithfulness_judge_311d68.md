## TARGET PowerSeries.SfinI (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{I : Type u_2} → (I → Set ℕ) → Set (I → ℕ)

Body:
fun {I} S => {k | (∀ (i : I), k i ∈ S i) ∧ PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite k}

Docstring: The set `S^I_fin` of essentially finite families in `∏_{i ∈ I} S_i`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} f => EssentiallyFinite f

Docstring: A family `f : I → ℕ` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are 0.
This corresponds to `S^I_fin` in the source.

**This is an alias** for the canonical `_root_.EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`.

This version is specialized to `ℕ` for use in product rule proofs. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A type with a zero element. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.support
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (ι → M) → Set ι

Docstring: `support` of a function is the set of points `x` such that `f x ≠ 0`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.fps.infprod.SfinI

\leanhelper  The set $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ of \emph{essentially finite families} in $\prod _{i \in I} S_i$ is the set of all families $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ such that $k_i \in S_i$ for all $i$ and the family $(k_i)$ is essentially finite.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.essfinite
def.fps.infprod.essFinite

\leanhelper  A family $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ of natural numbers is \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many entries equal $0$, i.e., the set $\{ i \in I : k_i \neq 0\} $ is finite. This corresponds to $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ in the source.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target defines `SfinI` for arbitrary `{I : Type u_2}` and `S : I \u2192 Set \u2115` by `{k | (\u2200 (i : I), k i \u2208 S i) \u2227 PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite k}`. This exactly matches the blueprint\u2019s families `(k_i)_{i \u2208 I}` satisfying \u201c`k_i \u2208 S_i` for all `i`\u201d and being \u201cessentially finite.\u201d The dependency unfolds `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite k` to `(Function.support k).Finite`; since `Function.support` is `{i | k i \u2260 0}`, this is precisely the informal definition that `{ i \u2208 I : k_i \u2260 0 }` is finite. No additional mathematical hypothesis or restriction is introduced."
