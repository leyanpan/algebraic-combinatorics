          SymmetricFunctions.SSYT lam

Docstring: A semistandard Young tableau (SSYT) of shape λ with entries in [N].
The entries are weakly increasing along rows and strictly increasing down columns.
Definition def.sf.ssyt.

**Note:** This is one of two SSYT definitions in this project:
- **This definition** (`SymmetricFunctions.SSYT`): Uses dependent types
  `entries : (i : Fin N) → (j : Fin (lam.parts i)) → Fin N`. Standalone structure.
  No `[NeZero N]` requirement. Field names: `rowWeak`, `colStrict`.
- **Alternative definition** (`SchurBasics.SSYT` in `SchurBasics.lean`): Uses
  `entry : Fin N × ℕ → Fin N` with a support condition. Extends `YoungTableau`.
  Requires `[NeZero N]`. Field names: `row_weak`, `col_strict`.

The equivalence between these definitions is established in `SSYTEquiv.lean` via
`SSYTEquiv.ssytEquiv`. Use `SSYTEquiv.toSchurBasicsSSYT` and `SSYTEquiv.toSFSSYT`
to convert between representations.

**When to use which:**
- Use this definition when the dependent type ensures bounds checking at compile time,
  or when `[NeZero N]` is not available.
- Use `SchurBasics.SSYT` when working with cell coordinates `(i, j)` directly, or when
  extending the `YoungTableau` structure is beneficial.

(N n : ℕ) → n ≤ N → SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N

Body:
fun N n _hn => { parts := fun i => if ↑i < n then 1 else 0, weaklyDecreasing := ⋯ }

Docstring: The column partition (1, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0) with n ones (n boxes in first column).
This is the partition corresponding to e_n (elementary symmetric polynomial).
Requires n ≤ N (can't have more rows than N).

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SymmetricFunctions.symToWeaklyIncreasing (def)

  have hlen := ⋯;
  ⟨fun i => ((↑s).sort fun x1 x2 => x1 ≤ x2).get ⟨↑i, ⋯⟩, ⋯⟩

Docstring: Convert a Sym to a weakly increasing function.
The sorted list of a multiset gives a canonical weakly increasing sequence. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SymmetricFunctions.NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
SymmetricFunctions.NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → (∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i) → SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a list of length N with weakly decreasing nonnegative entries.
This corresponds to Definition def.sf.N-par in the source.

**Note:** This is `SymmetricFunctions.NPartition`, a local definition.
A canonical top-level `NPartition` exists in `NPartition.lean` with the same
semantics (using `antitone` as the field name instead of `weaklyDecreasing`).
See the section docstring for details.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 5 < 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sort

  Finset α →
    (r : autoParam (α → α → Prop) Finset.sort._auto_1) →
      [DecidableRel r] → [IsTrans α r] → [Std.Antisymm r] → [Std.Total r] → List α

Docstring: `sort s` constructs a sorted list from the unordered set `s`.
(Uses merge sort algorithm.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLEFin
{n : ℕ} → LE (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.decLe
{n : ℕ} → (a b : Fin n) → Decidable (a ≤ b)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.
For more information: [Propositional Logic](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/propositions_and_proofs.html#propositional-logic)


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.elim0
{α : Sort u} → Fin 0 → α

Docstring: The type `Fin 0` is uninhabited, so it can be used to derive any result whatsoever.

This is similar to `Empty.elim`. It can be thought of as a compiler-checked assertion that a code
path is unreachable, or a logical contradiction from which `False` and thus anything else could be
derived.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sym
Type u_1 → ℕ → Type (max 0 u_1)

Docstring: The nth symmetric power is n-tuples up to permutation.  We define it
as a subtype of `Multiset` since these are well developed in the
library.  We also give a definition `Sym.sym'` in terms of vectors, and we
show these are equivalent in `Sym.symEquivSym'`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.sort
{α : Type u_1} →
  Multiset α →
    (r : autoParam (α → α → Prop) Multiset.sort._auto_1) →
      [DecidableRel r] → [IsTrans α r] → [Std.Antisymm r] → [Std.Total r] → List α

Docstring: `sort s` constructs a sorted list from the multiset `s`.
(Uses merge sort algorithm.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset
Type u → Type u

Docstring: `Multiset α` is the quotient of `List α` by list permutation. The result
is a type of finite sets with duplicates allowed. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Multiset α → ℕ

Docstring: The cardinality of a multiset is the sum of the multiplicities
of all its elements, or simply the length of the underlying list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.mk
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → (val : α) → p val → Subtype p

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.finset-to-col-ssyt

\leanhelper  Convert a subset $s \subseteq \mathrm{Fin}\, N$ of size $n$ to an SSYT of column partition shape $(1^n, 0^{N-n})$: column $0$ contains the sorted elements of $s$ in strictly increasing order.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.col-partition
def.sf.col-partition

\leanhelper  The \emph{column partition} $(1, 1, \ldots , 1, 0, \ldots , 0)$ with $n$ ones (i.e., $n$ boxes in the first column). This is the partition corresponding to $e_n$. Requires $n \leq N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ehp-through-m.onesthenzeros
def.sf.ehp-through-m.onesThenZeros

\leanhelper  The $N$-partition $(1, 1, \ldots , 1, 0, 0, \ldots , 0)$ with $n$ ones and $N - n$ zeros.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar-youngdiagram
def.sf.Npar-youngDiagram

\leanhelper  The \emph{Young diagram} $Y(\lambda )$ of an $N$-partition $\lambda $ is the finite set of cells 

\[  Y(\lambda ) = \{ (i, j) : i \in [N],\;  0 \leq j < \lambda _i\} .  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ssyt
def.sf.ssyt

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. 

A Young tableau $T$ of shape $\lambda $ is said to be \emph{semistandard} if its entries 

\begin{itemize} \item increase weakly along each row (from left to right); 

\item increase strictly down each column (from top to bottom). 

\end{itemize}

Formally speaking, this means that a Young tableau $T:Y\left( \lambda \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $ is semistandard if and only if 

\begin{itemize} \item we have $T\left( i,j\right) \leq T\left( i,j+1\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $ satisfying $\left( i,j+1\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $; 

\item we have $T\left( i,j\right) <T\left( i+1,j\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $ satisfying $\left( i+1,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $. 

\end{itemize}

We let $\operatorname *{SSYT}\left( \lambda \right) $ denote the set of all semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ydiag
def.sf.ydiag

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. 

The \emph{Young diagram} of $\lambda $ is defined as the set

\[  \left\{  \left( i,j\right) \  \mid \  i\in \left[ N\right] \text{ and }j\in \left[ \lambda _{i}\right] \right\}  \subseteq \left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  ^{2}.  \]

 We visually represent each element $\left( i,j\right) $ of this Young diagram as a box in row $i$ and column $j$. 

We denote the Young diagram of $\lambda $ by $Y\left( \lambda \right) $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ytab
def.sf.ytab

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. 

A \emph{Young tableau} of shape $\lambda $ means a way of filling the boxes of $Y\left( \lambda \right) $ with elements of $\left[ N\right] $ (one element per box). Formally speaking, it is defined as a map $T:Y\left( \lambda \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The informal statement asks to \u201cConvert a subset s \u2286 Fin N of size n to an SSYT of column partition shape (1^n, 0^{N-n}): column 0 contains the sorted elements of s in strictly increasing order.\u201d The target takes exactly `s : Finset (Fin N)` with `s.card = n` and returns `SymmetricFunctions.SSYT (SymmetricFunctions.NPartition.colPartition N n hn)`. The dependency `colPartition` has parts `if \u2191i < n then 1 else 0`, exactly the requested column shape. In the body, the sole entry in row `i < n` is `(s.sort fun x1 x2 => x1 \u2264 x2).get \u27e8\u2191i, \u2026\u27e9`, so column 0 is filled by the sorted elements of the duplicate-free finset; the resulting `SSYT` supplies strict increase down that column. The additional binder `hn : n \u2264 N` is not a substantive restriction: it is required to form `colPartition`, and it follows mathematically from `s : Finset (Fin N)` together with `s.card = n`. Thus it only exposes a redundant shape-validity proof and does not weaken the intended construction."
