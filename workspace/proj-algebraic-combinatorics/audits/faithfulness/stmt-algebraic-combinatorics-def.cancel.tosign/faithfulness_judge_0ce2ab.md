## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.toSign (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
ZMod 2 → ℤ

Body:
fun b => if b = 0 then 1 else -1

Docstring: Convert a ZMod 2 value to a sign: 0 ↦ 1, 1 ↦ -1 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ZMod
ℕ → Type

Docstring: The integers modulo `n : ℕ`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Neg.neg

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `neg` (when used as a unary operator).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Sign conversion

\leanhelper  The function $\operatorname {toSign} : \mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}$ converts elements of $\mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z}$ to signs: $\operatorname {toSign}(0) = 1$ and $\operatorname {toSign}(1) = -1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target has exactly the stated domain and codomain, `ZMod 2 \u2192 \u2124`, corresponding to `toSign : \u2124/2\u2124 \u2192 \u2124`. Its body, `fun b => if b = 0 then 1 else -1`, gives `toSign(0) = 1`; and for `1 : ZMod 2`, which is distinct from `0`, it gives `toSign(1) = -1`. Since `ZMod 2` has precisely the two residue classes represented by `0` and `1`, this matches the stated sign conversion without adding hypotheses or narrowing any quantifier."
