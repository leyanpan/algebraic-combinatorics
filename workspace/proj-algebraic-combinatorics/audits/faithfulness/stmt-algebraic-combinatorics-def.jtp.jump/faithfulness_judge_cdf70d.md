## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.jump (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
(S : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State) →
  (p : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) → (q : ℕ) → p ∈ S.levels → p + ↑q ∉ S.levels → q > 0 → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

Body:
fun S p q _hp _hpq _hq => { levels := S.levels \ {p} ∪ {p + ↑q}, finite_nonneg := ⋯, finite_negative_missing := ⋯ }

Docstring: Jump operation: if p ∈ S and p + q ∉ S, then jump_{p,q}(S) = (S \ {p}) ∪ {p + q}. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State (inductive)
Type

Body:
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.mk : (levels : Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) →
  {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ levels}.Finite → {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}.Finite → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

Docstring: A "state" is a set of levels that contains all but finitely many negative levels
and only finitely many positive levels.

This is used in Borcherds' proof of Jacobi's triple product identity.

**Important convention**: A "level" in the tex source is a half-integer `p + 1/2` for some integer p.
We represent it by the integer p. Thus:
- "positive level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 > 0`, i.e., `p ≥ 0` in our representation
- "negative level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 < 0`, i.e., `p < 0` in our representation

The structure tracks:
- `finite_nonneg`: the set of nonnegative integers p (representing positive half-integer levels) in S
- `finite_negative_missing`: the set of negative integers p (representing negative half-integer levels) NOT in S 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level (def)
Type

Body:
ℤ

Docstring: A "level" is a half-integer, represented as p + 1/2 for some integer p.
We represent it simply by the integer p. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.levels (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State → Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level

Body:
fun self => self.1

Docstring: The set of levels in this state 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.mk (constructor)
(levels : Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) →
  {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ levels}.Finite → {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}.Finite → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Union.union
{α : Type u} → [self : Union α] → α → α → α

Docstring: `a ∪ b` is the union of `a` and `b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∪` in identifiers is `union`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instUnion
{α : Type u} → Union (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SDiff.sdiff
{α : Type u} → [self : SDiff α] → α → α → α

Docstring: `a \ b` is the set difference of `a` and `b`,
consisting of all elements in `a` that are not in `b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `\` in identifiers is `sdiff`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instSDiff
{α : Type u} → SDiff (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Singleton.singleton
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {β : Type v} → [self : Singleton α β] → α → β

Docstring: `singleton x` is a collection with the single element `x` (notation: `{x}`). 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{x}` in identifiers is `singleton`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instSingletonSet
{α : Type u} → Singleton α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instLTInt
LT ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.jtp.jump

\leanhelper  If $S$ is a state, $p\in S$, and $q$ is a positive integer such that $p+q\notin S$, then the state 

\[  \operatorname {jump}_{p,q}S:=\left( S\setminus \left\{  p\right\}  \right) \cup \left\{  p+q\right\}   \]

 is said to be obtained from $S$ by letting the electron at level $p$ \emph{jump} $q$ steps to the right.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal binders exactly encode the blueprint hypotheses: `S : State`, `p : Level`, `q : \u2115`, `p \u2208 S.levels`, `p + \u2191q \u2209 S.levels`, and `q > 0` correspond to \u201cIf S is a state, p \u2208 S, and q is a positive integer such that p+q \u2209 S.\u201d Since `Level` is defined as `\u2124`, casting `q : \u2115` into the level type correctly represents moving a positive integer number of steps. The body has `levels := S.levels \\ {p} \u222a {p + \u2191q}`, exactly matching `(S \\ {p}) \u222a {p+q}`. The remaining constructor fields merely prove that this set is again a `State`, as the informal statement requires."
