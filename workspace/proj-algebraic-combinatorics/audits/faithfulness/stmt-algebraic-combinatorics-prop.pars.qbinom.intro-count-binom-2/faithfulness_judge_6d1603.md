## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.card_partitions_with_parts_and_largest (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (k ℓ : ℕ),
  0 < k → 0 < ℓ → (AlgebraicCombinatorics.monotoneFunctions (k - 1) (ℓ - 1)).card = (k + ℓ - 2).choose (k - 1)

Docstring: The number of partitions with exactly k parts and largest part exactly ℓ
equals the binomial coefficient `(k + ℓ - 2) choose (k - 1)`.

This counts lattice paths from (0,0) to (ℓ,k) that start with an east step
and end with a north step.

See Proposition 11.1.1 in the source. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.monotoneFunctions (def)
(k m : ℕ) → Finset (Fin k → Fin (m + 1))

Body:
fun k m => {f | Monotone f}

Docstring: The set of monotone functions from `Fin k` to `Fin (m + 1)`, representing
weakly increasing k-tuples with entries in `{0, 1, ..., m}`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.choose
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Docstring: `choose n k` is the number of `k`-element subsets in an `n`-element set. Also known as binomial
coefficients. For the fact that this is the number of `k`-element-subsets of an `n`-element
set, see `Finset.card_powersetCard`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Monotone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is monotone if `a ≤ b` implies `f a ≤ f b`.

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.pars.qbinom.intro-count-binom

For any positive integers $k$ and $\ell $, we have 

\[  \left(\text{\#  of partitions with }k\text{ parts and largest part }\ell \right) = \binom {k+\ell -2}{k-1}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.pars.largest-part-0
conv.pars.largest-part-0

We agree to say that the largest part of the empty partition $\left( {}\right) $ is $0$ (even though this partition has no parts).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.partsandlargestcount
def.pars.partsAndLargestCount

\leanhelper  Let $k,\ell \in \mathbb {N}$. 

\begin{enumerate} \item $q_{k,\ell }(n) := |\{ p \vdash n : \ell (p) = k,\; \text{largest part of }p = \ell \} |$. 

\item $Q(k,\ell ) := \sum _{n=k}^{k\ell } q_{k,\ell }(n)$, the total number of such partitions over all valid sizes. 

\end{enumerate}

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binders `\u2200 (k \u2113 : \u2115), 0 < k \u2192 0 < \u2113 \u2192` exactly match \u201cfor any positive integers k and \u2113.\u201d By the body of `monotoneFunctions`, the left side counts monotone maps `Fin (k - 1) \u2192 Fin ((\u2113 - 1) + 1)`, i.e. weakly increasing `(k-1)`-tuples with entries in `{0,\u2026,\u2113-1}`. These correspond bijectively to partitions with exactly `k` positive parts and largest part exactly `\u2113`: fix the first (largest) part as `\u2113`, reverse the remaining `k-1` weakly decreasing parts, and subtract `1`. Conversely, reverse this operation and prepend `\u2113`. Thus `(monotoneFunctions (k - 1) (\u2113 - 1)).card` is precisely the informal \u201c# of partitions with k parts and largest part \u2113.\u201d Under the positivity hypotheses, the natural-number expression `(k + \u2113 - 2).choose (k - 1)` agrees with the informal binomial coefficient `\\binom{k+\u2113-2}{k-1}`."
