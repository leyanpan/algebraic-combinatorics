## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.sum_choose_pow_eq (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (k : ℕ), PowerSeries.X ^ k * (1 - PowerSeries.X)⁻¹ ^ (k + 1) = PowerSeries.mk fun n => ↑(n.choose k)

Docstring: **Equation `eq.fps.mulvar.exa1.res1`**: The generating function identity
`x^k / (1-x)^{k+1} = ∑_{n∈ℕ} C(n,k) x^n` for each `k ∈ ℕ`.

This is derived from the bivariate identity by comparing coefficients of `y^k`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular

{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

coefficients. For the fact that this is the number of `k`-element-subsets of an `n`-element
set, see `Finset.card_powersetCard`.

\[  \frac{x^{k}}{\left( 1-x\right) ^{k+1}}=\sum _{n\in \mathbb {N}}\binom {n}{k}x^{n}  \]

 as an identity in $\mathbb {Q}[[x]]$. This is an equality between \textbf{univariate} FPSs, even though we have obtained it by manipulating \textbf{bivariate} FPSs.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.kalg
def.alg.Kalg

A $K$\emph{-algebra} is a set $A$ equipped with four maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \ominus &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \odot &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times A\rightarrow A \end{align*}

 and two elements $\overrightarrow {0}\in A$ and $\overrightarrow {1}\in A$ satisfying the following properties: 

\begin{enumerate} \item The set $A$, equipped with the maps $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ and the two elements $\overrightarrow {0}$ and $\overrightarrow {1}$, is a (noncommutative) ring. 

\item The set $A$, equipped with the maps $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ and the element $\overrightarrow {0}$, is a $K$-module. 

\item We have

\begin{equation}  \lambda \rightharpoonup \left( a\odot b\right) =\left( \lambda \rightharpoonup a\right) \odot b=a\odot \left( \lambda \rightharpoonup b\right) \end{equation}

 for all $\lambda \in K$ and $a,b\in A$. 

\end{enumerate}

(Thus, in a nutshell, a $K$-algebra is a set $A$ that is simultaneously a ring and a $K$-module, with the property that the ring $A$ and the $K$-module $A$ have the same addition, the same subtraction and the same zero, and satisfy the additional compatibility property (\ref{eq.def.alg.Kalg.scaleinv}).)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.module
def.alg.module

Let $K$ be a commutative ring. 

A $K$\emph{-module} means a set $M$ equipped with three maps 

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \ominus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times M\rightarrow M \end{align*}

 (notice that the third map has domain $K\times M$, not $M\times M$) and an element $\overrightarrow {0}\in M$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in M$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of scaling:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) =\left( uv\right) \rightharpoonup a$ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left distributivity:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( a\oplus b\right) =\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( u\rightharpoonup b\right) $ for all $u\in K$ and $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right distributivity:} We have $\left( u+v\right) \rightharpoonup a=\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) $ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $1\rightharpoonup a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left annihilation:} We have $0\rightharpoonup a=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right annihilation:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $u\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{scaling} (or the $K$\emph{-action}) of the $K$-module $M$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\rightharpoonup b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The element $\overrightarrow {0}$ is called the \emph{zero} (or the \emph{zero vector}) of the $K$-module $M$. We will usually just call it $0$. 

When $M$ is a $K$-module, the elements of $M$ are called \emph{vectors}, while the elements of $K$ are called \emph{scalars}. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $, with the operation $\rightharpoonup $ having higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.ring
def.alg.ring

The notion of a \emph{ring} (also known as a \emph{noncommutative ring}) is defined in the exact same way as we defined the notion of a commutative ring in Definition~ \ref{def.alg.commring}, except that the “Commutativity of multiplication” axiom is removed.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.geometric-series

\leanhelper  The \emph{geometric series} is the FPS $\frac{1}{1-x} = (1-x)^{-1} \in K[[x]]$ (where $K$ is a field).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.gf
def.fps.gf

\leanhelper  The \emph{(ordinary) generating function} of a sequence $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots )$ is the FPS $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots ) = \sum _{n\geq 0} a_n x^n$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.mulvar.algebra
def.fps.mulvar.algebra

\leanhelper  Let $k\in \mathbb {N}$. The $K$-algebra of all FPSs in $k$ variables $x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{k}$ over $K$ will be denoted by $K\left[ \left[ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{k}\right] \right] $. 

Sometimes we will use different names for our variables. For example, if we work with $2$ variables, we will commonly call them $x$ and $y$ instead of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. Correspondingly, we will use the notation $K\left[ \left[ x,y\right] \right] $ for the $K$-algebra of FPSs in these two variables.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.mulvar.binomialgenfun
def.fps.mulvar.binomialGenFun

\leanhelper  The \emph{binomial generating function} is the bivariate power series 

\[  \operatorname {BinGen} := \sum _{n,k\in \mathbb {N}} \binom {n}{k}\,  x^n y^k \in \mathbb {Q}[[x,y]],  \]

 whose coefficient at $x^n y^k$ is $\binom {n}{k}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.x
def.fps.x

Let $x$ denote the FPS $\left(0,1,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. In other words, let $x$ denote the FPS with $\left[x^{1}\right]x=1$ and $\left[x^{i}\right]x=0$ for all $i\neq 1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binder `\u2200 (k : \u2115)` exactly matches \u201cFor each $k \\in \\mathbb N$.\u201d The equality is between univariate formal power series over `\u211a`: `PowerSeries.X` is the formal variable, and `PowerSeries.mk fun n => \u2191(n.choose k)` constructs the series whose $n$-th rational coefficient is $\\binom nk$. Thus the right side represents `\u2211_{n\u2208\u2115} binom n k x^n` under the informal generating-function definition. The left side `PowerSeries.X ^ k * (1 - PowerSeries.X)\u207b\u00b9 ^ (k + 1)` is $x^k(1-x)^{-(k+1)}=x^k/(1-x)^{k+1}$. Finally, `Nat.choose` is documented as the binomial coefficient, agreeing with the informal definition for natural `n` and `k`. No extra hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers are present."
