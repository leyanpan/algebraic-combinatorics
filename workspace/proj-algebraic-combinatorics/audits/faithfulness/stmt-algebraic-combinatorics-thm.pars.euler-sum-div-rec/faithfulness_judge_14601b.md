Docstring: **Theorem \ref{thm.pars.euler-sum-div-rec}**: Euler's recursion for the sum of divisors.

For each positive integer n:
  ∑_{k∈ℤ, w_k < n} (-1)^k σ(n - w_k) =
    { (-1)^{k-1} n,  if n = w_k for some k ∈ ℤ
    { 0,            otherwise

where σ(n) is the sum of all positive divisors of n.

The proof compares coefficients of x^n in the identity x * Q' = -Q * S, where
Q is the pentagonal series and S is the sum of divisors generating function.

Note: The sign (-1)^k is computed using `k.natAbs` to handle negative k correctly.
For any integer k, (-1)^k = (-1)^|k| since (-1)^{-m} = (-1)^m.
Similarly, (-1)^{k-1} = (-1)^{|k|+1} for k ≠ 0.

## Proof Strategy (from tex source)

The proof requires Euler's pentagonal number theorem (`euler_pentagonal_number_theorem`)
which states: ∏_{k≥1} (1 - x^k) = ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k}

The key identity used is: xQ' = -QS where
- Q = ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k} (pentagonal series)
- S = ∑_{n>0} σ(n) x^n (sum of divisors generating function)
- P = ∑_{n≥0} p(n) x^n (partition generating function)

This is derived from:
1. PQ = 1 (from Euler's pentagonal theorem and partition generating function)
2. xP' = SP (identity relating partition function derivative to σ)
3. Taking derivatives and using PQ = 1 gives xQ' = -QS

Then comparing coefficients of x^n on both sides of
  ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k w_k x^{w_k} = -QS
gives the result.

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber (def)
ℤ → ℕ

Body:
fun k => ((3 * k - 1) * k / 2).toNat

Docstring: The k-th pentagonal number, defined as w_k = (3k - 1) * k / 2.
This is always a nonnegative integer for any k ∈ ℤ.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pent-num}) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumberInverse (def)
ℕ → Option ℤ

Body:
fun n =>
  have bound := n + 1;
  have posResult :=
    List.find? (fun k => decide (AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber k = n)) do
      let a ← List.range bound
      pure ↑a;
  match posResult with
  | some k => some k
  | none =>
    have negResult :=
      List.find? (fun k => decide (AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber (-k - 1) = n)) do
        let a ← List.range bound
        pure ↑a;
    match negResult with
    | some k => some (-k - 1)
    | none => none

Docstring: Helper: Check if n is a pentagonal number and return the corresponding k.
Returns none if n is not a pentagonal number.

This is computable for any given n by checking a finite range of k values,
since pentagonal numbers grow quadratically. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF tsum
{α : Type u_4} →
  {β : Type u_5} →
    [AddCommMonoid α] →
      [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Docstring: `∑' i, f i` is the unconditional sum of `f` if it exists, or 0 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∑'[L] i, f i` is the sum of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `0` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional sum exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice, to use the sum
over the support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a` satisfying `HasSum f a`. Similar remarks
apply to more general summation filters.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.natAbs
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: The absolute value of an integer is its distance from `0`.

This function is overridden by the compiler with an efficient implementation. This definition is
the logical model.

Examples:
 * `(7 : Int).natAbs = 7`
 * `(0 : Int).natAbs = 0`
 * `(-11 : Int).natAbs = 11`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ArithmeticFunction
(R : Type u_1) → [Zero R] → Type (max 0 u_1)

Docstring: An arithmetic function is a function from `ℕ` that maps 0 to 0. In the literature, they are
often instead defined as functions from `ℕ+`. Multiplication on `ArithmeticFunctions` is by
Dirichlet convolution.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ArithmeticFunction.sigma

Docstring: `σ k n` is the sum of the `k`th powers of the divisors of `n` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SummationFilter.unconditional
(β : Type u_2) → SummationFilter β

Docstring: **Unconditional summation**: a function on `β` is said to be *unconditionally summable* if its
partial sums over finite subsets converge with respect to the `atTop` filter. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Option
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Optional values, which are either `some` around a value from the underlying type or `none`.

`Option` can represent nullable types or computations that might fail. In the codomain of a function
type, it can also represent partiality.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.toNat
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: Converts an integer into a natural number. Negative numbers are converted to `0`.

Examples:
* `(7 : Int).toNat = 7`
* `(0 : Int).toNat = 0`
* `(-7 : Int).toNat = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHDiv
{α : Type u_1} → [Div α] → HDiv α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDiv
Div ℤ

Docstring: The `Div Int` and `Mod Int` instances use `Int.ediv` and `Int.emod` for compatibility with SMT-LIB and
because mathematical reasoning tends to be easier.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.find?
{α : Type u} → (α → Bool) → List α → Option α

Docstring: Returns the first element of the list for which the predicate `p` returns `true`, or `none` if no
such element is found.

`O(|l|)`.

Examples:
* `[7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].find? (· < 5) = some 1`
* `[7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].find? (· < 1) = none`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable.decide
(p : Prop) → [h : Decidable p] → Bool

Docstring: Converts a decidable proposition into a `Bool`.

If `p : Prop` is decidable, then `decide p : Bool` is the Boolean value
that is `true` if `p` is true and `false` if `p` is false.

DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Bind.bind
{m : Type u → Type v} → [self : Bind m] → {α β : Type u} → m α → (α → m β) → m β

Docstring: Sequences two computations, allowing the second to depend on the value computed by the first.

If `x : m α` and `f : α → m β`, then `x >>= f : m β` represents the result of executing `x` to get
a value of type `α` and then passing it to `f`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>>=` in identifiers is `bind`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.range

Docstring: Returns a list of the numbers from `0` to `n` exclusive, in increasing order.

`O(n)`.

Examples:
* `range 5 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
* `range 0 = []`
* `range 2 = [0, 1]`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Pure.pure
{f : Type u → Type v} → [self : Pure f] → {α : Type u} → α → f α

Docstring: Given `a : α`, then `pure a : f α` represents an action that does nothing and returns `a`.

Examples:
* `(pure "hello" : Option String) = some "hello"`
* `(pure "hello" : Except (Array String) String) = Except.ok "hello"`
* `(pure "hello" : StateM Nat String).run 105 = ("hello", 105)`

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
thm.pars.euler-sum-div-rec

For any positive integer $n$, let $\sigma (n)$ denote the sum of all positive divisors of $n$. 

Then, for each positive integer $n$, we have 

\[  \sum _{\substack {k\in \mathbb {Z};\\ w_{k}<n}}\left( -1\right) ^{k}\sigma \left( n-w_{k}\right) = \begin{cases}  \left( -1\right) ^{k-1}n, &  \text{if }n=w_{k}\text{ for some }k\in \mathbb {Z};\\ 0, &  \text{if not.} \end{cases}  \]

 (Here, $w_{k}$ is the $k$-th pentagonal number, defined in Definition \ref{def.pars.pent-num}.)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.pent-num
def.pars.pent-num

For any $k\in \mathbb {Z}$, define a nonnegative integer $w_{k}\in \mathbb {N}$ by 

\[  w_{k}=\frac{\left( 3k-1\right) k}{2}.  \]

 This is called the $k$\emph{-th pentagonal number}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binder `\u2200 n > 0` matches \u201cfor each positive integer n.\u201d The subtype index `{ k // pentagonalNumber k < n }` represents exactly the integers satisfying `w_k < n`, and `(ArithmeticFunction.sigma 1)` is the sum of first powers of divisors, hence the stated sum-of-divisors function. The formal signs `(-1) ^ (\u2191k).natAbs` and, in the exceptional case, `(-1) ^ (k.natAbs + 1)` agree with `(-1)^k` and `(-1)^(k-1)` respectively by parity; in the exceptional case positivity of `n = w_k` excludes `k = 0`. The body of `pentagonalNumber` implements `((3*k - 1)*k)/2`, and `pentagonalNumberInverse` searches sufficient finite ranges to return an index exactly when positive `n` equals some `w_k`. Thus its `some k` and `none` branches faithfully encode the two cases in the blueprint."
