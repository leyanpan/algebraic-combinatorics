## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.psum_zero_eq_N (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommSemiring R] {N : ℕ}, MvPolynomial.psum (Fin N) R 0 = ↑N

Docstring: The n = 0 case: p_0 = N while m_{(0,...,0)} = 1.

This documents why `power_sum_eq_monomialSymm` requires `n ≠ 0`.
When n = 0:
- `psum 0 = ∑ i, X i ^ 0 = N` (constant polynomial)
- `monomialSymm (singletonPartition 0 hN) = 1` (single monomial x^0 = 1)

These are equal only when N = 1. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommSemiring
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative semiring is a semiring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.psum
(σ : Type u_5) → (R : Type u_6) → [inst : CommSemiring R] → [Fintype σ] → ℕ → MvPolynomial σ R

Docstring: The degree-`n` power sum symmetric `MvPolynomial σ R`.
It is the sum over all the `n`-th powers of the variables. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.psum-zero

\leanhelper  $p_0 = \sum _{i=1}^N x_i^0 = N$ (the constant polynomial $N$). This differs from the convention $p_0 = 1$ used in some textbooks; when $N > 0$ the identity $p_n = m_{(n,0,\ldots ,0)}$ requires $n > 0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.sf.kn
conv.sf.KN

Fix a commutative ring $K$. Fix an $N\in \mathbb {N}$. Throughout this chapter, we will keep $K$ and $N$ fixed. Let $S_N$ denote the symmetric group, i.e., the group of all permutations of $[N] := \{ 1,2,\ldots ,N\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ehp
def.sf.ehp

\textbf{(a)} For each $n \in \mathbb {Z}$, define a symmetric polynomial $e_n \in \mathcal{S}$ by 

\[  e_n = \sum _{\substack {(i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_n) \in [N]^n; \\ i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_n}} x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_n} = (\text{sum of all squarefree monomials of degree } n).  \]

 This $e_n$ is called the $n$-th \emph{elementary symmetric polynomial} in $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} For each $n \in \mathbb {Z}$, define a symmetric polynomial $h_n \in \mathcal{S}$ by 

\[  h_n = \sum _{\substack {(i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_n) \in [N]^n; \\ i_1 \leq i_2 \leq \cdots \leq i_n}} x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_n} = (\text{sum of all monomials of degree } n).  \]

 This $h_n$ is called the $n$-th \emph{complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial} in $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} For each $n \in \mathbb {Z}$, define a symmetric polynomial $p_n \in \mathcal{S}$ by 

\begin{align*}  p_n & = \begin{cases}  x_1^n + x_2^n + \cdots + x_N^n, &  \text{if } n > 0; \\ 1, &  \text{if } n = 0; \\ 0, &  \text{if } n < 0 \end{cases}\\ & = (\text{sum of all primal monomials of degree } n). \end{align*}

 This $p_n$ is called the $n$-th \emph{power sum} in $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ehp-through-m.singletonpartition
def.sf.ehp-through-m.singletonPartition

\leanhelper  The $N$-partition $(n, 0, 0, \ldots , 0)$ with $n$ in the first position and zeros elsewhere.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.m
def.sf.m

Let $\lambda $ be any $N$-partition. Then, we define a symmetric polynomial $m_{\lambda }\in \mathcal{S}$ by

\[  m_{\lambda }:=\sum _{\substack {a\in \mathbb {N}^{N};\\ \operatorname *{sort}a=\lambda }}x^{a}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{monomial symmetric polynomial corresponding to }$\lambda $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.monomial
def.sf.monomial

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{monomial} is an expression of the form $x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ with $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N \in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{degree} $\deg \mathfrak {m}$ of a monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is defined to be $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_N \in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} A monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is said to be \emph{squarefree} if $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N \in \{ 0,1\} $. (This is saying that no square or higher power of an indeterminate appears in $\mathfrak {m}$; thus the name “squarefree”.) \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} A monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is said to be \emph{primal} if there is at most one $i \in [N]$ satisfying $a_i > 0$. (This is saying that the monomial $\mathfrak {m}$ contains no two distinct indeterminates. Thus, a primal monomial is just $1$ or a power of an indeterminate.)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ps
def.sf.PS

\textbf{(a)} Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the polynomial ring $K[x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N]$ in $N$ variables over $K$. This is not just a ring; it is a commutative $K$-algebra. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The symmetric group $S_N$ acts on the set $\mathcal{P}$ according to the formula 

\[  \sigma \cdot f = f[x_{\sigma (1)}, x_{\sigma (2)}, \ldots , x_{\sigma (N)}] \quad \text{for any } \sigma \in S_N \text{ and any } f \in \mathcal{P}.  \]

 Here, $f[a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N]$ means the result of substituting $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N$ for the indeterminates $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N$ in a polynomial $f \in \mathcal{P}$. 

Roughly speaking, the group $S_N$ is thus acting on $\mathcal{P}$ by permuting variables: A permutation $\sigma \in S_N$ transforms a polynomial $f$ by substituting $x_{\sigma (i)}$ for each $x_i$. 

Note that this action of $S_N$ on $\mathcal{P}$ is a well-defined group action (as we will see in Proposition~ \ref{prop.sf.SN-acts} below). \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} A polynomial $f \in \mathcal{P}$ is said to be \emph{symmetric} if it satisfies 

\[  \sigma \cdot f = f \quad \text{for all } \sigma \in S_N.  \]

\textbf{(d)} We let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all symmetric polynomials $f \in \mathcal{P}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.sort
def.sf.sort

Let $a=\left( a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} We let $x^{a}$ denote the monomial $x_{1}^{a_{1}}x_{2}^{a_{2}}\cdots x_{N}^{a_{N}}$. 

\textbf{(b)} We let $\operatorname *{sort}a$ mean the $N$-partition obtained from $a$ by sorting the entries of $a$ in weakly decreasing order.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal conclusion `MvPolynomial.psum (Fin N) R 0 = \u2191N` exactly expresses the blueprint\u2019s main assertion `$p_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^0 = N$ (the constant polynomial $N$)`: `MvPolynomial.psum` is documented as the sum of the powers of all variables, `Fin N` supplies exactly `N` variables, and `\u2191N` is the constant polynomial obtained from the natural-number cast. The binder `[inst : CommSemiring R]` is weaker than the blueprint setting \u201cFix a commutative ring $K$,\u201d so the theorem is strictly more general and in particular implies the claimed result for every commutative ring. The remarks about the alternative convention and the restriction `n > 0` explain the significance of the zero case rather than adding a separate conclusion to this lemma."
