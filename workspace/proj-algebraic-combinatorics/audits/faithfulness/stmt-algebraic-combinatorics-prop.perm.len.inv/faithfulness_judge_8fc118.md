## TARGET Equiv.Perm.length_inv (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), σ⁻¹.length = σ.length

Docstring: **Proposition prop.perm.len.inv**: The length of a permutation equals the length
of its inverse: ℓ(σ⁻¹) = ℓ(σ).

The proof establishes a bijection between inversions of σ and inversions of σ⁻¹:
if (i,j) is an inversion of σ, then (σ(j), σ(i)) is an inversion of σ⁻¹. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.length (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} σ => σ.inversions.card

Docstring: The length of a permutation is the number of its inversions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.inversions (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n × Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ => {p | p.1 < p.2 ∧ σ p.2 < σ p.1}

Docstring: The set of inversions of a permutation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Inv.inv
{α : Type u} → [self : Inv α] → α → α

Docstring: `a⁻¹` computes the inverse of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instInv
{α : Type u_4} → Inv (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.

the assumption `Fintype α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.perm.len.inv

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_n$. Then, $\ell (\sigma ^{-1}) = \ell (\sigma )$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies over \u201cLet n \u2208 \u2115 and \u03c3 \u2208 S_n\u201d and concludes \u201c\u2113(\u03c3\u207b\u00b9) = \u2113(\u03c3).\u201d The elaborated signature quantifies over exactly the corresponding data, \u201c\u2200 {n : \u2115} (\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), \u03c3\u207b\u00b9.length = \u03c3.length,\u201d with no added hypotheses. By `Equiv.Perm.length`, length is `\u03c3.inversions.card`, and `Equiv.Perm.inversions` consists of pairs satisfying `p.1 < p.2 \u2227 \u03c3 p.2 < \u03c3 p.1`, exactly the informal condition i < j and \u03c3(i) > \u03c3(j). `Fin n` uses the order-isomorphic zero-based model of the informal set `[n] = {1,\u2026,n}`; shifting indices by one preserves order, inversions, and inverse permutations. Thus the formal equality is the stated equality of Coxeter lengths."
