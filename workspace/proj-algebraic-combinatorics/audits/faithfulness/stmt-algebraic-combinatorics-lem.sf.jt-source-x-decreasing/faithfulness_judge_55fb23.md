∀ {N : ℕ} (mu : Fin N → ℕ),
  (∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → mu j ≤ mu i) →
    ∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → SymmetricFunctions.jacobiTrudiSourceX mu j ≤ SymmetricFunctions.jacobiTrudiSourceX mu i

Docstring: The source x-coordinates are weakly decreasing.
This follows from the partition being weakly decreasing:
μᵢ - i ≥ μⱼ - j when i ≤ j, since μᵢ ≥ μⱼ and i ≤ j.

Body:
fun {N} mu i => ↑(mu i) - ↑↑i

Docstring: The source vertex A_i = (μ_i - i, 1) for the Jacobi-Trudi LGV setup.
Here 1 represents the "starting height" in the lattice. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLEFin

LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

LE ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.jt-source-x-decreasing

\leanhelper  The source $x$-coordinates are weakly decreasing: $\mu _i - i \geq \mu _j - j$ when $i \leq j$. This follows from the partition being weakly decreasing: $\mu _i \geq \mu _j$ and $i \leq j$ imply $\mu _i - i \geq \mu _j - j$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.lattice
def.lgv.lattice

We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ (so the vertices are pairs of integers) and arcs 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i+1,j\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}  \]

 and 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i,j+1\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}.  \]

 The arcs of the first form are called \emph{east-steps} or \emph{right-steps}; the arcs of the second form are called \emph{north-steps} or \emph{up-steps}. 

The vertices of this digraph will be called \emph{lattice points} or \emph{grid points} or simply \emph{points}. 

The entire digraph will be denoted by $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ and called the \emph{integer lattice} or \emph{integer grid}. 

Any path is uniquely determined by its starting point and its step sequence.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.path-tups
def.lgv.path-tups

Let $k\in \mathbb {N}$. 

\textbf{(a)} A $k$\emph{-vertex} means a $k$-tuple of lattice points. 

\textbf{(b)} If $\mathbf{A}=\left( A_{1},A_{2},\ldots ,A_{k}\right) $ is a $k$-vertex, and if $\sigma \in S_{k}$ is a permutation, then $\sigma \left( \mathbf{A}\right) $ shall denote the $k$-vertex $\left( A_{\sigma \left( 1\right) },A_{\sigma \left( 2\right) },\ldots ,A_{\sigma \left( k\right) }\right) $. 

\textbf{(c)} If $\mathbf{A}=\left( A_{1},A_{2},\ldots ,A_{k}\right) $ and $\mathbf{B}=\left( B_{1},B_{2},\ldots ,B_{k}\right) $ are two $k$-vertices, then a \emph{path tuple} from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ means a $k$-tuple $\left( p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}\right) $, where each $p_{i}$ is a path from $A_{i}$ to $B_{i}$. 

\textbf{(d)} A path tuple $\left( p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}\right) $ is said to be \emph{non-intersecting} if no two of the paths $p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}$ have any vertex in common. We abbreviate “non-intersecting path tuple” as \emph{nipat}. 

\textbf{(e)} A path tuple $\left( p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{k}\right) $ is said to be \emph{intersecting} if it is not non-intersecting (i.e., if two of its paths have a vertex in common). We abbreviate “intersecting path tuple” as \emph{ipat}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

\leanhelper  Define two $N$-vertices $\mathbf{A} = (A_1, \ldots , A_N)$ and $\mathbf{B} = (B_1, \ldots , B_N)$ by 

\[  A_i := (\mu _i - i,\;  1) \quad \text{and} \quad B_i := (\lambda _i - i,\;  N) \quad \text{for each } i \in [N].  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binder `(\u2200 (i j : Fin N), i \u2264 j \u2192 mu j \u2264 mu i)` exactly encodes that `mu` is a weakly decreasing `N`-tuple of naturals, matching the informal hypothesis that an `N`-partition satisfies `\u03bc\u1d62 \u2265 \u03bc\u2c7c` for `i \u2264 j`. Expanding `jacobiTrudiSourceX` in the conclusion gives `\u2191(mu j) - \u2191j \u2264 \u2191(mu i) - \u2191i`, i.e. `\u03bc\u1d62 - i \u2265 \u03bc\u2c7c - j`, as required. Although `Fin N` is zero-indexed while the blueprint writes indices `1,\u2026,N`, translating a blueprint index `i` to `Fin` value `i-1` shifts every formal source coordinate by the same constant `+1`; this does not change the asserted weak-decreasing inequalities. Thus the formal theorem implies the blueprint statement."
