## TARGET NPartition.parts_le_size (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {N : ℕ} (μ : NPartition N) (i : Fin N), μ.parts i ≤ μ.size

## TARGET NPartition.eq_zero_of_size_eq_zero (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE

## TARGET NPartition.size_eq_zero_iff (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE

## TARGET SymmetricFunctions.NPartition.size (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{N : ℕ} → SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} lam => ∑ i, lam.parts i

Docstring: The size (sum of parts) of an N-partition 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.size (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} μ => ∑ i, μ.parts i

Docstring: The size (or weight) of an N-partition is the sum of its entries.
If μ = (μ₁, μ₂, ..., μ_N), then |μ| = μ₁ + μ₂ + ... + μ_N. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.instZero (def)

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.zero (def)

Body:

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.mk (constructor)

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SymmetricFunctions.NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
SymmetricFunctions.NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → (∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i) → SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a list of length N with weakly decreasing nonnegative entries.
This corresponds to Definition def.sf.N-par in the source.

**Note:** This is `SymmetricFunctions.NPartition`, a local definition.
A canonical top-level `NPartition` exists in `NPartition.lean` with the same
semantics (using `antitone` as the field name instead of `weaklyDecreasing`).
See the section docstring for details. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SymmetricFunctions.NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The parts of the partition 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero.toOfNat0
{α : Type u_1} → [Zero α] → OfNat α 0

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Iff
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: If and only if, or logical bi-implication. `a ↔ b` means that `a` implies `b` and vice versa.
By `propext`, this implies that `a` and `b` are equal and hence any expression involving `a`
is equivalent to the corresponding expression with `b` instead.

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

the assumption `Fintype α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.Npar-size

\leanhelper  Let $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ be an $N$-partition. 

\begin{itemize} \item Each entry is bounded by the size: $\lambda _i \leq |\lambda |$ for all $i$. 

\item $|\lambda | = 0$ if and only if $\lambda = (0, \ldots , 0)$. 

\end{itemize}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal declarations match both bullets and the defining notation. For the first bullet, the blueprint says \u201cEach entry is bounded by the size: \u03bb\u1d62 \u2264 |\u03bb| for all i,\u201d and `NPartition.parts_le_size` quantifies `\u2200 {N : \u2115} (\u03bc : NPartition N) (i : Fin N), \u03bc.parts i \u2264 \u03bc.size`; `Fin N` ranges over exactly the N entries, while `NPartition.size` is defined as `\u2211 i, \u03bc.parts i`. For the second bullet, the blueprint says \u201c|\u03bb| = 0 if and only if \u03bb = (0, \u2026, 0),\u201d and `NPartition.size_eq_zero_iff` states `\u03bc.size = 0 \u2194 \u03bc = 0`, with `NPartition.zero` defined by the constantly-zero parts function. `NPartition.eq_zero_of_size_eq_zero` additionally states the forward implication and is consistent with the biconditional. Both `NPartition` representations require natural-valued weakly decreasing parts, exactly the informal definition, and `SymmetricFunctions.NPartition.size` likewise defines size as the sum of all parts. Allowing arbitrary `N : \u2115`, including zero, is at most a harmless generalization because the informal statement imposes no positivity condition on N."
