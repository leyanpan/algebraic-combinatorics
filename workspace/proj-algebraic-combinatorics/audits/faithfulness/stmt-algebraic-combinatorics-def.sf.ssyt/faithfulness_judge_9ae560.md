Docstring: A semistandard Young tableau (SSYT) is a tableau where:
- entries increase weakly along each row (left to right)
- entries increase strictly down each column (top to bottom)

Definition \ref{def.sf.ssyt} in the source.

Formally, a Young tableau T : Y(λ) → [N] is semistandard if and only if:
- T(i, j) ≤ T(i, j+1) for any (i, j) ∈ Y(λ) with (i, j+1) ∈ Y(λ)
- T(i, j) < T(i+1, j) for any (i, j) ∈ Y(λ) with (i+1, j) ∈ Y(λ)

The set of all semistandard Young tableaux of shape λ is denoted SSYT(λ).

**Note:** This is one of two SSYT definitions in this project:
- **This definition** (`SchurBasics.SSYT`): Uses `entry : Fin N × ℕ → Fin N` with a support
  condition that entries outside the Young diagram are 0. Extends `YoungTableau`.
  Requires `[NeZero N]`. Field names: `row_weak`, `col_strict`.
- **Alternative definition** (`SymmetricFunctions.SSYT` in `PieriJacobiTrudi.lean`): Uses
  dependent types `entries : (i : Fin N) → (j : Fin (lam.parts i)) → Fin N`. Standalone
  structure. No `[NeZero N]` requirement. Field names: `rowWeak`, `colStrict`.

The equivalence between these definitions is established in `SSYTEquiv.lean` via
`SSYTEquiv.ssytEquiv`. Use `SSYTEquiv.toSchurBasicsSSYT` and `SSYTEquiv.toSFSSYT`
to convert between representations.

**When to use which:**
- Use this definition when working with cell coordinates `(i, j)` directly, or when
  extending the `YoungTableau` structure is beneficial.
- Use `SymmetricFunctions.SSYT` when the dependent type ensures bounds checking at
  compile time, or when `[NeZero N]` is not available. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY YoungTableau (inductive)

  [inst : NeZero N] →
    {lam : NPartition N} → (entry : Fin N × ℕ → Fin N) → (∀ c ∉ lam.youngDiagram, entry c = 0) → YoungTableau lam

Docstring: A Young tableau of shape lam is a filling of the Young diagram Y(lam) with elements of [N].
Definition \ref{def.sf.ytab} in the source. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.youngDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} μ => Finset.univ.biUnion fun i => Finset.map { toFun := fun j => (i, j), inj' := ⋯ } (Finset.range (μ.parts i))

Docstring: The Young diagram Y(λ) of an N-partition λ is the set of cells (i, j) where
i ∈ Fin N and j < λ_i.
Definition def.sf.ydiag in the source.

Note: Mathlib has `YoungDiagram` which is more general (infinite diagrams).
Here we define a version specific to N-partitions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY YoungTableau.entry (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → {lam : NPartition N} → YoungTableau lam → Fin N × ℕ → Fin N

Body:

Docstring: The filling function 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF NeZero
{R : Type u_1} → [Zero R] → R → Prop

Docstring: A type-class version of `n ≠ 0`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLEFin
{n : ℕ} → LE (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is antitone if `a ≤ b` implies `f b ≤ f a`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PartialOrder.toPreorder
{α : Type u_2} → [self : PartialOrder α] → Preorder α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.instPartialOrder
{n : ℕ} → PartialOrder (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instPreorder
Preorder ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → [NeZero n] → {i : ℕ} → OfNat (Fin n) i

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.biUnion
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq β] → Finset α → (α → Finset β) → Finset β

Docstring: `Finset.biUnion s t` is the union of `t a` over `a ∈ s`.

(This was formerly `bind` due to the monad structure on types with `DecidableEq`.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqProd
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq α] → [DecidableEq β] → DecidableEq (α × β)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α ↪ β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Embedding.mk
{α : Sort u_1} → {β : Sort u_2} → (toFun : α → β) → Function.Injective toFun → α ↪ β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range
ℕ → Finset ℕ

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.ssyt

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. 

A Young tableau $T$ of shape $\lambda $ is said to be \emph{semistandard} if its entries 

\begin{itemize} \item increase weakly along each row (from left to right); 

\item increase strictly down each column (from top to bottom). 

\end{itemize}

Formally speaking, this means that a Young tableau $T:Y\left( \lambda \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $ is semistandard if and only if 

\begin{itemize} \item we have $T\left( i,j\right) \leq T\left( i,j+1\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $ satisfying $\left( i,j+1\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $; 

\item we have $T\left( i,j\right) <T\left( i+1,j\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $ satisfying $\left( i+1,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda \right) $. 

\end{itemize}

We let $\operatorname *{SSYT}\left( \lambda \right) $ denote the set of all semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ydiag
def.sf.ydiag

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. 

The \emph{Young diagram} of $\lambda $ is defined as the set

\[  \left\{  \left( i,j\right) \  \mid \  i\in \left[ N\right] \text{ and }j\in \left[ \lambda _{i}\right] \right\}  \subseteq \left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  ^{2}.  \]

 We visually represent each element $\left( i,j\right) $ of this Young diagram as a box in row $i$ and column $j$. 

We denote the Young diagram of $\lambda $ by $Y\left( \lambda \right) $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ytab
def.sf.ytab

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. 

A \emph{Young tableau} of shape $\lambda $ means a way of filling the boxes of $Y\left( \lambda \right) $ with elements of $\left[ N\right] $ (one element per box). Formally speaking, it is defined as a map $T:Y\left( \lambda \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The formal declaration is restricted by the binder `{N : \u2115} \u2192 [NeZero N] \u2192 NPartition N \u2192 Type`, whereas the blueprint only says \u201cLet \u03bb be an N-partition\u201d and defines an N-partition as an arbitrary weakly decreasing `N`-tuple, without assuming `N \u2260 0`. Thus the formal definition excludes `N = 0`, for which the empty partition and its empty tableau are mathematically meaningful. The restriction enters through both `YoungTableau` and `SSYT`, because `YoungTableau.entry : Fin N \u00d7 \u2115 \u2192 Fin N` is total even outside the diagram and its support condition uses the literal `0 : Fin N`, requiring `[NeZero N]`. This is not merely needed for the blueprint\u2019s cell-indexed map `T : Y(\u03bb) \u2192 [N]`; a dependent cell-domain representation can express the empty case. To make it faithful, remove `[NeZero N]` by defining entries only on cells of `lam.youngDiagram` (as in the stated alternative dependent representation), and then remove the binder from `SSYT`; alternatively, the blueprint would need to assume `N \u2260 0`. Apart from this restriction, the all-pairs conditions in the constructors are equivalent to the blueprint\u2019s adjacent-cell conditions: Young diagrams are initial segments in rows, antitonicity makes upper cells present whenever lower cells are, and adjacent inequalities iterate to arbitrary `j\u2081 < j\u2082` or `i\u2081 < i\u2082`."
