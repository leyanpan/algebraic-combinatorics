## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.catalan_gf_explicit (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
2 • ((PowerSeries.mk fun n => ↑(AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.catalan n)) * PowerSeries.X) =
  1 - PowerSeries.mk fun n => Ring.choose (1 / 2) n * (-4) ^ n

Docstring: The generating function of the Catalan numbers is related to $\sqrt{1 - 4x}$.

The exact formula $C(x) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x}$ is reformulated as
$2x \cdot C(x) = 1 - \sqrt{1 - 4x}$ to avoid division by $x$ in power series
(since $x$ is not a unit in the ring of formal power series).

The square root $\sqrt{1 - 4x}$ is represented by the binomial series
$\sum_{n \geq 0} \binom{1/2}{n} (-4x)^n = \sum_{n \geq 0} \binom{1/2}{n} (-4)^n x^n$.

Equation \eqref{eq.sec.gf.exas.2.-}. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.catalan (def)
ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun n => (2 * n).choose n / (n + 1)

Docstring: The Catalan numbers, defined as $c_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$.

**Mathlib note**: This is equivalent to Mathlib's `catalan`, which is defined recursively.
The equivalence is proved by `catalan_eq_mathlib_catalan`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Rat

Docstring: `a • b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent, but it is intended to be used for left actions. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `•` in identifiers is `smul`.

Docstring: The identity map inducing an `Algebra` structure. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.mk
{R : Type u_2} → (ℕ → R) → PowerSeries R

Docstring: Constructor for formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
thm.catalan.gf_explicit

\leanhelper  The generating function of the Catalan numbers satisfies 

\[  2x\, C(x) = 1 - \sqrt{1-4x},  \]

 where $\sqrt{1-4x} = \sum _{n\geq 0}\binom {1/2}{n}(-4)^n x^n$ is the binomial series.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target states exactly the formal-power-series identity over \u211a: `2 \u2022 ((PowerSeries.mk fun n => \u2191(AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.catalan n)) * PowerSeries.X) = 1 - PowerSeries.mk fun n => Ring.choose (1 / 2) n * (-4) ^ n`. Here `PowerSeries.mk fun n => \u2191(catalan n)` is `C(x)`, `PowerSeries.X` is `x`, and scalar multiplication by `2` gives the left side `2x C(x)`. The right-hand `PowerSeries.mk` has coefficient `Ring.choose (1 / 2) n * (-4)^n`, exactly matching the blueprint\u2019s definition `\u221a(1-4x) = \u2211_{n\u22650} binom(1/2,n)(-4)^n x^n`. The dependency `catalan n := (2*n).choose n / (n+1)` also agrees with the Catalan-number coefficients used informally. There are no additional hypotheses or restricted binders."
