is semilinear if it satisfies the two properties `f (x + y) = f x + f y` and
`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time.

Docstring: The `n`th coefficient of a formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
cor.fps.lim.sum-prod-k

Let $k\in \mathbb {N}$. For each $i\in \left\{  1,2,\ldots ,k\right\}  $, let $f_{i}$ be an FPS, and let $\left( f_{i,n}\right) _{n\in \mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of FPSs such that

\[  \lim \limits _{n\rightarrow \infty }\left( f_{i,n}\right) =f_{i} \]

 (note that it is $n$, not $i$, that goes to $\infty $ here!). Then,

\[  \lim \limits _{n\rightarrow \infty }\sum _{i=1}^{k}f_{i,n}=\sum _{i=1}^{k}f_{i}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \lim \limits _{n\rightarrow \infty }\prod _{i=1}^{k}f_{i,n}=\prod _{i=1}^{k}f_{i}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.coeff-stab
def.fps.lim.coeff-stab

Let $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] ^{\mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of FPSs over $K$. Let $f\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $ be an FPS. 

We say that $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ \emph{coefficientwise stabilizes to }$f$ if for each $n\in \mathbb {N}$,

\[  \text{the sequence }\left( \left[ x^{n}\right] f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}\text{ stabilizes to }\left[ x^{n}\right] f.  \]

If $f_{i}$ coefficientwise stabilizes to $f$ as $i\rightarrow \infty $, then we write $\lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }f_{i}=f$ and say that $f$ is the \emph{limit} of $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$. This is legitimate, because $f$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.stab
def.fps.lim.stab

Let $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of elements of $K$. Let $a\in K$. 

We say that the sequence $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ \emph{stabilizes to }$a$ if there exists some $N\in \mathbb {N}$ such that

\[  \text{all integers }i\geq N\text{ satisfy }a_{i}=a.  \]

If $a_{i}$ stabilizes to $a$ as $i\rightarrow \infty $, then we write $\lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }a_{i}=a$ and say that $a$ is the \emph{limit} (or \emph{eventual value}) of $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$. This is legitimate, since $a$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "Taken together, the two targets correctly cover the informal conjunction: the sum target proves \u201clim \u2026 \u2211 = \u2211\u201d and the product target proves \u201clim \u2026 \u220f = \u220f\u201d. Replacing `{1,\u2026,k}` by an arbitrary `s : Finset \u03b9` is a faithful strengthening/generalization, and `\u2200 i \u2208 s, PowerSeries.CoeffStabilizesTo (f i) (lf i)` matches the stated pointwise convergence assumptions. However, both elaborated signatures add `[inst : CommRing K]`, while the supplied informal statement and definitions never state that `K` is a commutative ring. This restriction also enters through `PowerSeries.CoeffStabilizesTo`, whose declaration itself has `[CommRing K]`. Thus the formal results only cover commutative-ring coefficients, an additional mathematically contentful hypothesis not supplied by the blueprint. To make them faithful, either the blueprint must explicitly fix `K` as a commutative ring, or `PowerSeries.CoeffStabilizesTo` and these targets should be generalized to the weakest coefficient structure supporting the operations\u2014at least `CommSemiring K` for the arbitrary-finset product formulation."
