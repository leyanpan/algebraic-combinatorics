Docstring: A commutative semiring is a semiring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Semiring
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A `Semiring` is a type with addition, multiplication, a `0` and a `1` where addition is

addition, and `0` and `1` are additive and multiplicative identities. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Pow
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The homogeneous version of `HPow`: `a ^ b : α` where `a : α`, `b : β`.
(The right argument is not the same as the left since we often want this even
in the homogeneous case.)

Types can choose to subscribe to particular defaulting behavior by providing
an instance to either `NatPow` or `HomogeneousPow`:
- `NatPow` is for types whose exponents is preferentially a `Nat`.
- `HomogeneousPow` is for types whose base and exponent are preferentially the same.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.qbinomial-formulas.b-mul-pow-a

\leanhelper  Let $A$ be an $L$-algebra, let $\omega \in L$, and let $a, b \in A$ satisfy $ba = \omega \cdot ab$. Then for all $k \in \mathbb {N}$: 

\[  b \cdot a^k = \omega ^k \cdot (a^k \cdot b).  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "discrepancies": [],
  "justification": "The formal signature exactly matches the blueprint: `[CommRing L]`, `[Ring A]`, and `[Algebra L A]` encode \u201cLet A be an L-algebra\u201d; `(\u03c9 : L) (a b : A)` matches the chosen elements; the hypothesis `b * a = \u03c9 \u2022 (a * b)` is precisely `ba = \u03c9 \u00b7 ab`; and `\u2200 (k : \u2115), b * a ^ k = \u03c9 ^ k \u2022 (a ^ k * b)` is precisely the claimed identity for every natural number k. The scalar action `\u2022` is the algebra\u2019s action of L on A, as required."
