## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.eulerProduct (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → PowerSeries R

Body:
fun {R} [CommRing R] => ∏' (k : ℕ), (1 - PowerSeries.X ^ (k + 1))

Docstring: The Euler product ∏_{k≥1} (1 - x^k).

This is defined using the discrete topology on R, which ensures the infinite product
is well-defined via Mathlib's infrastructure for infinite products of power series.
The product is multipliable because the order of (1 - X^k) is k, which tends to infinity. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Body:
fun R => MvPowerSeries Unit R

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF tprod
{α : Type u_4} →
  {β : Type u_5} →
    [CommMonoid α] → [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Body:
wrapped✝.1

Docstring: `∏' i, f i` is the unconditional product of `f`, if it exists, or 1 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∏'[L] i, f i` is the product of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `1` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional product exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the multiplicative support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice,
to use the product over the multiplicative support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a`
satisfying `HasProd f a`. Similar remarks apply to more general summation filters.)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF TopologicalSpace

Docstring: A topology on `X`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE
Type u → Type u

Docstring: `LE α` is the typeclass which supports the notation `x ≤ y` where `x y : α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OrderBot

Docstring: An order is an `OrderBot` if it has a least element.
We state this using a data mixin, holding the value of `⊥` and the least element constraint. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Preorder
Type u_2 → Type u_2

Docstring: A preorder is a reflexive, transitive relation `≤`.
In a preorder, `a < b` means `a ≤ b ∧ ¬b ≤ a`, and `<` is defined this way by default.

Docstring: A partial order is a reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric relation `≤`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SemilatticeSup

Docstring: A `SemilatticeSup` is a join-semilattice, that is, a partial order
with a join (a.k.a. lub / least upper bound, sup / supremum) operation
`⊔` which is the least element larger than both factors. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Lattice
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A lattice is a join-semilattice which is also a meet-semilattice. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CompleteLattice
Type u_8 → Type u_8

## BASE-LIBRARY REF TopologicalSpace.instCompleteLattice
{α : Type u} → CompleteLattice (TopologicalSpace α)

Body:
fun {α} => (TopologicalSpace.gciGenerateFrom α).liftCompleteLattice

Docstring: Topologies on `α` form a complete lattice, with `⊥` the discrete topology
and `⊤` the indiscrete topology. The infimum of a collection of topologies
is the topology generated by all their open sets, while the supremum is the
topology whose open sets are those sets open in every member of the collection. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF BoundedOrder
(α : Type u) → [LE α] → Type u

Docstring: A bounded order describes an order `(≤)` with a top and bottom element,
denoted `⊤` and `⊥` respectively. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sub

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sub.sub
{α : Type u} → [self : Sub α] → α → α → α

Body:
fun α [self : Sub α] => self.1

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`. See `HSub`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SubNegMonoid
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A `SubNegMonoid` is an `AddMonoid` with unary `-` and binary `-` operations
satisfying `sub_eq_add_neg : ∀ a b, a - b = a + -b`.

The default for `sub` is such that `a - b = a + -b` holds by definition.

Adding `sub` as a field rather than defining `a - b := a + -b` allows us to
avoid certain classes of unification failures, for example:
Let `foo X` be a type with a `∀ X, Sub (Foo X)` instance but no
`∀ X, Neg (Foo X)`. Suppose we also have an instance
`∀ X [Cromulent X], AddGroup (Foo X)`. Then the `(-)` coming from
`AddGroup.sub` cannot be definitionally equal to the `(-)` coming from
`Foo.Sub`.

In the same way, adding a `zsmul` field makes it possible to avoid definitional failures
in diamonds. See the definition of `AddMonoid` and Note [forgetful inheritance] for more
explanations on this.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF AddGroup
Type u → Type u

Docstring: An `AddGroup` is an `AddMonoid` with a unary `-` satisfying `-a + a = 0`.

There is also a binary operation `-` such that `a - b = a + -b`,
with a default so that `a - b = a + -b` holds by definition.

Use `AddGroup.ofLeftAxioms` or `AddGroup.ofRightAxioms` to define an
additive group structure on a type with the minimum proof obligations.

`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time.

(The right argument is not the same as the left since we often want this even
in the homogeneous case.)

an instance to either `NatPow` or `HomogeneousPow`:
- `NatPow` is for types whose exponents is preferentially a `Nat`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.pent.eulerProduct

\leanhelper  The \emph{Euler product} is the infinite product 

\[  \prod _{k=1}^{\infty }(1 - x^k) \in R[[x]],  \]

 defined as a multipliable product in the Pi topology on $R[[x]]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.ismultipliable
def.fps.lim.isMultipliable

\leanhelper  A family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ of FPSs is \emph{multipliable} if (1) $[x^0]f_i = 1$ for all $i$, and (2) for each $n \in \mathbb {N}$, there exists $N$ such that for all $i \geq N$ and all $k \leq n$, $[x^k]f_i = \delta _{k,0}$ (i.e., eventually all $f_i$ are $\equiv 1 \pmod{x^{n+1}}$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.tprod
def.fps.lim.tprod

\leanhelper  The \emph{infinite product} of a multipliable family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ is the FPS $\prod _{n \in \mathbb {N}} f_n$ whose $n$-th coefficient equals $[x^n](\prod _{j=0}^{N} f_j)$ for any sufficiently large $N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.xneq
def.fps.xneq

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $f,g\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ be two FPSs. We write $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$ if and only if 

\[  \text{each }m\in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots ,n\right\} \text{ satisfies } \left[x^{m}\right]f=\left[x^{m}\right]g.  \]

Thus, we have defined a binary relation $\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }$ on the set $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$. We say that an FPS $f$ is $x^{n}$\emph{-equivalent} to an FPS $g$ if and only if $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$.

  "discrepancies": [
    {
      "root": "the body of `AlgebraicCombinatorics.eulerProduct`",
      "severity": "minor",
      "bridge": "Prove that the family `k \u21a6 1 - PowerSeries.X ^ (k + 1)` is multipliable in the Pi topology. Directly from the blueprint criterion, every factor has constant coefficient `1`; for any degree bound `n`, taking `N = n` ensures that when `k \u2265 N`, the term `X^(k+1)` has no coefficients in degrees at most `n`. Thus the partial products stabilize coefficientwise, yielding a `HasProd` for the library `tprod` and excluding its fallback value `1`. Under this stabilization, the unconditional finite-subset product agrees with the blueprint's sufficiently long initial-segment product. This is a routine convergence argument for this concrete family."
    }
  ],
  "justification": "The blueprint explicitly says the Euler product is \u201cdefined as a multipliable product in the Pi topology.\u201d The formal body is only `\u220f' (k : \u2115), (1 - PowerSeries.X ^ (k + 1))`. By the supplied `tprod` documentation, this denotes the product \u201cif it exists, or 1 otherwise\u201d; the declaration itself does not assert that the family has a product. The indexing is otherwise correct: `k : \u2115` with exponent `k + 1` represents the factors indexed from 1, and the available topology references support the stated discrete-coefficient Pi topology. The omitted multipliability fact is immediate from degree stabilization, so the discrepancy is minor."
