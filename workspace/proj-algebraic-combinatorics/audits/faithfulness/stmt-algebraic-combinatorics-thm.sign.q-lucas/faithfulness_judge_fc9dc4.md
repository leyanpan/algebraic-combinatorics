Docstring: **q-Lucas Theorem** (thm.sign.q-lucas)

Let `K` be a field, `d` a positive integer, and `ω` a primitive `d`-th root of unity in `K`.
For `n, k : ℕ`, write `n = q * d + r` and `k = u * d + v` where `0 ≤ r, v < d`.
Then:
  `[n choose k]_ω = (q choose u) * [r choose v]_ω`

This generalizes the formula for `[n choose k]_{-1}` (which is the case `d = 2`).

**Proof idea:** The proof uses a generalization of sign-reversing involutions to d-cycles.
The key insight is that for a primitive d-th root of unity ω, we have
  ∑_{i=0}^{d-1} ω^i = 0 (when d > 1)
This allows cancellation of terms that don't respect the "block structure" where blocks
are consecutive intervals of size d: {0,...,d-1}, {d,...,2d-1}, etc.

A k-element subset S of {0,...,n-1} can be decomposed into:
1. Which "full blocks" it contains (choosing k/d blocks from n/d available blocks)
2. Which elements of the "partial block" {(n/d)*d, ..., n-1} it contains

For subsets that don't respect the block structure, we can define a d-cycle that
permutes related subsets, and the sum of ω^(exponent) over each cycle is zero.
The remaining terms correspond to "blocky" subsets, giving the product formula.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.qBinomial (def)
ℕ → ℕ → Polynomial ℤ

Body:
fun n k => ∑ S ∈ (Finset.range n).powerset with S.card = k, Polynomial.X ^ (S.sum id - (Finset.range k).sum id)

Docstring: The q-binomial coefficient `[n choose k]_q = [n]_q! / ([k]_q! * [n-k]_q!)`.
This is well-defined as a polynomial (the division is exact).

We define it combinatorially using the sum over k-element subsets formula:
`[n choose k]_q = ∑_{S ⊆ [n], |S|=k} q^{sum(S) - (1+2+...+k)}`

**Note:** This is a local definition as `Polynomial ℤ`, equivalent to
`AlgebraicCombinatorics.qBinomial n k X` from `QBinomialBasic.lean` when the latter
is evaluated as a polynomial. The equivalence follows from `qBinomial_eq_sum_subsets`.
This definition uses 0-indexed sets `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` while `QBinomialBasic` uses
1-indexed sets `{1, 2, ..., n}` in its subset formula, but both are equivalent. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Field
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A `Field` is a `CommRing` with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.

An instance of `Field K` includes maps `ratCast : ℚ → K` and `qsmul : ℚ → K → K`.
Those two fields are needed to implement the `DivisionRing K → Algebra ℚ K` instance since we need
to control the specific definitions for some special cases of `K` (in particular `K = ℚ` itself).
See also note [forgetful inheritance].

If the field has positive characteristic `p`, our division by zero convention forces
`ratCast (1 / p) = 1 / 0 = 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

and if `l` satisfies `ζ ^ l = 1` then `k ∣ l`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Docstring: Defining the homomorphism in the category R-Alg, denoted `A →ₐ[R] B`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Polynomial

Docstring: `Polynomial R` is the type of univariate polynomials over `R`,
denoted as `R[X]` within the `Polynomial` namespace.

Polynomials should be seen as (semi-)rings with the additional constructor `X`.
The embedding from `R` is called `C`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`.

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
q-Lucas theorem

Let $K$ be a field. Let $d$ be a positive integer. Let $\omega $ be a primitive $d$-th root of unity in $K$. Let $n, k \in \mathbb {N}$. Let $q$ and $u$ be the quotients obtained when dividing $n$ and $k$ by $d$ with remainder, and let $r$ and $v$ be the respective remainders. Then, 

\[  \binom {n}{k}_{\omega } = \binom {q}{u} \cdot \binom {r}{v}_{\omega }.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

Let $K$ be a field. Let $d$ be a positive integer. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{$d$-th root of unity} in $K$ means an element $\omega $ of $K$ satisfying $\omega ^d = 1$. 

\textbf{(b)} A \emph{primitive $d$-th root of unity} in $K$ means an element $\omega $ of $K$ satisfying $\omega ^d = 1$ but $\omega ^i \neq 1$ for each $i \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , d-1\} $. In other words, a primitive $d$-th root of unity in $K$ means an element of the multiplicative group $K^{\times }$ whose order is $d$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal binders exactly match the blueprint assumptions: `\u2200 {K : Type u_1} [Field K] (d : \u2115), 0 < d \u2192 \u2200 (\u03c9 : K), IsPrimitiveRoot \u03c9 d \u2192 \u2200 (n k : \u2115)`. The library definition of `IsPrimitiveRoot` gives `\u03c9 ^ d = 1` and exact multiplicative order `d`, equivalent here to the blueprint\u2019s primitive-root definition. The conclusion uses the quotient and remainder terms directly: `(n / d).choose (k / d)` and `qBinomial (n % d) (k % d)`, corresponding to `q,u,r,v`. The dependency `qBinomial n k` is the standard subset-sum polynomial `\u2211 q^(sum S \u2212 (0+\u22ef+(k\u22121)))`, equivalent for natural `n,k` to the blueprint\u2019s partition definition of the Gaussian binomial coefficient; it is zero when `k > n`, as is the blueprint definition. `Polynomial.aeval \u03c9` evaluates this polynomial at `\u03c9`, and the natural binomial coefficient is canonically cast into `K`. Thus the displayed Lean equality is precisely `binom(n,k)_\u03c9 = binom(q,u) \u00b7 binom(r,v)_\u03c9`."
