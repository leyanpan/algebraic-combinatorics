## TARGET Nat.Partition.transpose_largestPart_eq_length (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (p : n.Partition), p.transpose.largestPart = p.numParts

Docstring: The largest part of the transpose equals the length of the original partition. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.largestPart (def)
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} p => Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts

Docstring: The largest part of a partition (0 for the empty partition).
(Convention \ref{conv.pars.largest-part-0}) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.transpose (def)
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → n.Partition

Body:
fun {n} p =>
  let largest := Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts;
  let newParts := Multiset.map (fun i => (Multiset.filter (fun x => x > i) p.parts).card) (Finset.range largest).val;
  { parts := Multiset.filter (fun x => x > 0) newParts, parts_pos := ⋯, parts_sum := ⋯ }

Docstring: The transpose (conjugate) of a partition.
For a partition λ = (λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₖ), the transpose λᵗ is defined by:
- The Young diagram of λᵗ is the transpose of the Young diagram of λ
- Equivalently: (λᵗ)ᵢ = #{j : λⱼ ≥ i}

The transpose satisfies:
- |λᵗ| = |λ| (same size)
- (λᵗ)ᵗ = λ (involution)
- length(λᵗ) = largest part of λ
- largest part of λᵗ = length(λ) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.numParts (def)
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} p => p.parts.card

Docstring: The number of parts of a partition equals the cardinality of its parts multiset. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

the multiset `s`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

Docstring: `map f s` is the lift of the list `map` operation. The multiplicity
of `b` in `map f s` is the number of `a ∈ s` (counting multiplicity)
such that `f a = b`.

Docstring: `Filter p s` returns the elements in `s` (with the same multiplicities)
which satisfy `p`, and removes the rest. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.pars.transpose-largestPart-eq-length

\leanhelper  The largest part of the transpose equals the length of the original partition: largest part of $\lambda ^t$ = $\ell (\lambda )$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npartition-transpose
def.sf.npartition-transpose

\leanhelper  The \emph{transpose} (or \emph{conjugate}) of an $N$-partition $\lambda $ is the partition $\lambda ^t$ whose $i$-th part equals $|\{ j : j < N,\;  \lambda _j > i\} |$, i.e., the number of parts of $\lambda $ that exceed $i$. Requires $N > 0$; the result is a partition of length $\lambda _1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint says \u201clargest part of \u03bb\u1d57 = \u2113(\u03bb).\u201d The target states exactly `\u2200 {n : \u2115} (p : n.Partition), p.transpose.largestPart = p.numParts`. Here `p.numParts` is `p.parts.card`, matching the informal length `m`, while `transpose` forms the parts `#{x \u2208 p.parts : x > i}` over `i < largest`, matching the informal formula `|{j : j < N, \u03bb_j > i}|`. Finally, `largestPart` is the maximum of those parts. The formal theorem also covers the empty partition using the declared convention that its largest part is `0`; this is a harmless extension beyond the informal transpose definition\u2019s `N > 0` requirement, not a weakening of the blueprint claim."
