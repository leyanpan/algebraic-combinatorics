## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF IsUnit
{M : Type u_1} → [Monoid M] → M → Prop

Docstring: An element `a : M` of a `Monoid` is a unit if it has a two-sided inverse.
The actual definition says that `a` is equal to some `u : Mˣ`, where
`Mˣ` is a bundled version of `IsUnit`.

                [inst_3 : AddCommMonoid M₂] → [_root_.Module R M] → [_root_.Module S M₂] → Type (max u_16 u_17)

Docstring: A map `f` between an `R`-module and an `S`-module over a ring homomorphism `σ : R →+* S`
is semilinear if it satisfies the two properties `f (x + y) = f x + f y` and
`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time.

Docstring: The `n`th coefficient of a formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HasSubset.Subset
{α : Type u} → [self : HasSubset α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: Subset relation: `a ⊆ b`  

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `⊆` in identifiers is `subset`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instHasSubset
{α : Type u_1} → HasSubset (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Fubini rule for infinite products, invertible case

Let $I$ and $J$ be two sets. Let $\left(\mathbf{a}_{(i,j)}\right)_{(i,j)\in I\times J}\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]^{I\times J}$ be a multipliable family of invertible FPSs. Then, 

\[  \prod _{i\in I}\; \; \prod _{j\in J}\mathbf{a}_{(i,j)} =\prod _{(i,j)\in I\times J}\mathbf{a}_{(i,j)} =\prod _{j\in J}\; \; \prod _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{(i,j)}.  \]

 (In particular, all the products appearing in this equality are well-defined.)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

\textbf{(a)} We say that $M$ \emph{determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the sum of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ if every finite subset $J$ of $I$ satisfying $M\subseteq J\subseteq I$ satisfies 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in J}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in M}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right).  \]

\textbf{(b)} We say that $M$ \emph{determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ if every finite subset $J$ of $I$ satisfying $M\subseteq J\subseteq I$ satisfies 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\prod _{i\in J}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\left[x^{n}\right]\left(\prod _{i\in M}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right).  \]

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.multipliable

Let $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ be a (possibly infinite) family of FPSs. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} The family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ is said to be \emph{multipliable} if and only if each coefficient in its product is finitely determined. 

\textbf{(b)} If the family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ is multipliable, then its \emph{product} $\prod _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS whose $x^{n}$-coefficient (for any $n\in \mathbb {N}$) can be computed as follows: If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $M$ is a finite subset of $I$ that determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of $\left( \mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$, then 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\prod _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\left[x^{n}\right]\left(\prod _{i\in M}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right).  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

Let $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]^{I}$ be a (possibly infinite) family of FPSs. Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. 

\textbf{(a)} We say that \emph{the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the sum of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ \emph{is finitely determined} if there is a finite subset $M$ of $I$ that determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the sum of $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$. 

\textbf{(b)} We say that \emph{the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ \emph{is finitely determined} if there is a finite subset $M$ of $I$ that determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$.

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The target concludes only \u201c(\u2200 (i : I), PowerSeries.Multipliable fun j => a (i, j)) \u2227 \u2200 (j : J), PowerSeries.Multipliable fun i => a (i, j)\u201d. This establishes multipliability of each row and column, whereas the blueprint principally asserts the equalities \u201c\u220f\u1d62 \u220f\u2c7c a_(i,j) = \u220f_(i,j) a_(i,j) = \u220f\u2c7c \u220f\u1d62 a_(i,j)\u201d and says that all products in those equalities are well-defined. No equality of products appears in the formal conclusion, nor does it establish multipliability of the families of inner products needed for the two outer products. Thus the formal theorem captures only part of the parenthetical well-definedness claim and not the Fubini rule itself. The difference enters in the conclusion of `PowerSeries.fubini_prod_invertible`. To make it faithful, the project must first provide a formal infinite-product construction for `PowerSeries.Multipliable` families corresponding to informal definition part (b), and the target must conclude the two iterated products are defined and equal to the product over `I \u00d7 J`. The hypothesis `\u2200 p, IsUnit (coeff 0 (a p))` is the usual characterization of invertibility for a formal power series over a commutative ring, so it is not the decisive mismatch."
