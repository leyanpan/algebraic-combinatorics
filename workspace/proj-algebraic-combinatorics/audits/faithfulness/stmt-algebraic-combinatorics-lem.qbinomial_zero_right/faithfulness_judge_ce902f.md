## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.qBinomial_zero_right (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n : ℕ), AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.qBinomial n 0 = 1

Docstring: q-binomial boundary case: [n choose 0]_q = 1 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting.qBinomial (def)
ℕ → ℕ → Polynomial ℤ

Body:
fun n k => ∑ S ∈ (Finset.range n).powerset with S.card = k, Polynomial.X ^ (S.sum id - (Finset.range k).sum id)

Docstring: The q-binomial coefficient `[n choose k]_q = [n]_q! / ([k]_q! * [n-k]_q!)`.
This is well-defined as a polynomial (the division is exact).

We define it combinatorially using the sum over k-element subsets formula:
`[n choose k]_q = ∑_{S ⊆ [n], |S|=k} q^{sum(S) - (1+2+...+k)}`

**Note:** This is a local definition as `Polynomial ℤ`, equivalent to
`AlgebraicCombinatorics.qBinomial n k X` from `QBinomialBasic.lean` when the latter
is evaluated as a polynomial. The equivalence follows from `qBinomial_eq_sum_subsets`.
This definition uses 0-indexed sets `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` while `QBinomialBasic` uses
1-indexed sets `{1, 2, ..., n}` in its subset formula, but both are equivalent. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Polynomial
(R : Type u_1) → [Semiring R] → Type u_1

Docstring: `Polynomial R` is the type of univariate polynomials over `R`,
denoted as `R[X]` within the `Polynomial` namespace.

Polynomials should be seen as (semi-)rings with the additional constructor `X`.
The embedding from `R` is called `C`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSemiring
Semiring ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.powerset
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → Finset (Finset α)

Docstring: When `s` is a finset, `s.powerset` is the finset of all subsets of `s` (seen as finsets). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HPow.hPow
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HPow α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a ^ b` computes `a` to the power of `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `^` in identifiers is `pow`.

Docstring: `X` is the polynomial variable (aka indeterminate). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instAddCommMonoid
AddCommMonoid ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF id
{α : Sort u} → α → α

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.qBinomial_zero_right

\leanhelper  For all $n \in \mathbb {N}$, $\binom {n}{0}_q = 1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint states, \u201cFor all $n \\in \\mathbb N$, $\\binom n0_q=1$.\u201d The elaborated signature matches this exactly: `\u2200 (n : \u2115), ...qBinomial n 0 = 1`, with no additional hypotheses or restricted quantifiers. The project definition interprets `qBinomial` as a polynomial in `Polynomial \u2124`; at `k = 0`, its combinatorial sum ranges over the unique zero-cardinality subset (the empty set), whose exponent is `0`, yielding the constant polynomial `1`. Thus the formal equality has the intended meaning."
