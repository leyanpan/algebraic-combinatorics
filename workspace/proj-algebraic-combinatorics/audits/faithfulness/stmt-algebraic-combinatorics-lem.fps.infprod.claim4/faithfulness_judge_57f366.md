## TARGET PowerSeries.prodRule_claim4 (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] {I : Type u_2} (p : I → ℕ → PowerSeries K),
  (∀ (i : I), p i 0 = 1) → ∀ (k : I → ℕ), PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite k → {i | p i (k i) ≠ 1}.Finite

Docstring: Claim 4: For an essentially finite family `(k_i)` with `p_{i,0} = 1`,
the family `(p_{i,k_i})` is multipliable (all but finitely many terms are 1).
(Claim 4) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} f => EssentiallyFinite f

Docstring: A family `f : I → ℕ` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are 0.
This corresponds to `S^I_fin` in the source.

**This is an alias** for the canonical `_root_.EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`.

This version is specialized to `ℕ` for use in product rule proofs. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPowerSeries.instOne
{σ : Type u_1} → {R : Type u_2} → [Semiring R] → One (MvPowerSeries σ R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommSemiring
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → CommSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass

Docstring: A type with a zero element. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.support
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (ι → M) → Set ι

Docstring: `support` of a function is the set of points `x` such that `f x ≠ 0`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.infprod.claim4

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Claim 4.)} If $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ is essentially finite and $p_{i,0} = 1$ for all $i$, then the family $(p_{i,k_i})_{i \in I}$ is multipliable.

def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

\textbf{(a)} We say that $M$ \emph{determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the sum of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ if every finite subset $J$ of $I$ satisfying $M\subseteq J\subseteq I$ satisfies 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in J}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in M}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right).  \]

\textbf{(b)} We say that $M$ \emph{determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ if every finite subset $J$ of $I$ satisfying $M\subseteq J\subseteq I$ satisfies

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.multipliable

Let $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ be a (possibly infinite) family of FPSs. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} The family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ is said to be \emph{multipliable} if and only if each coefficient in its product is finitely determined. 

\textbf{(b)} If the family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ is multipliable, then its \emph{product} $\prod _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS whose $x^{n}$-coefficient (for any $n\in \mathbb {N}$) can be computed as follows: If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $M$ is a finite subset of $I$ that determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the product of $\left( \mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$, then 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\prod _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\left[x^{n}\right]\left(\prod _{i\in M}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right).  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

Let $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]^{I}$ be a (possibly infinite) family of FPSs. Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. 

\textbf{(a)} We say that \emph{the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the sum of} $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ \emph{is finitely determined} if there is a finite subset $M$ of $I$ that determines the $x^{n}$-coefficient in the sum of $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$.

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target assumes exactly the stated hypotheses: `(\u2200 (i : I), p i 0 = 1)` and, for `k : I \u2192 \u2115`, `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite k`, whose body is `(Function.support k).Finite`, i.e. all but finitely many `k i` are zero. Its conclusion `{i | p i (k i) \u2260 1}.Finite` says that all but finitely many selected FPSs `p i (k i)` equal `1`. This is stronger than the informal conclusion that `(p_{i,k_i})` is multipliable: taking that finite exceptional set as `M`, every finite extension of `M` adds only factors equal to `1`, so every coefficient of the product is determined by `M`, exactly as required by `def.fps.multipliable`. The converse need not hold\u2014an infinite family can be multipliable without all but finitely many factors being `1`\u2014but a stronger conclusion is faithful under the stated standard. The `[CommRing K]` binder supplies the algebraic setting for the FPS operations rather than changing the claim."
