(Definition def.fps.laure.balanced-tern, label: def.fps.laure.balanced-tern)

A balanced ternary representation of an integer `n` is a finitely supported
function `f : ℕ → ℤ` with values in {-1, 0, 1} such that `n = ∑_i f(i) · 3^i`.

Unlike binary representations (where digits are 0 or 1), balanced ternary
allows digits to be -1, 0, or 1. This enables direct representation of
negative integers without a separate sign.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finsupp
Type u_9 → (M : Type u_10) → [Zero M] → Type (max u_10 u_9)

Docstring: `Finsupp α M`, denoted `α →₀ M`, is the type of functions `f : α → M` such that
`f x = 0` for all but finitely many `x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

Docstring: `{a} : Finset a` is the set `{a}` containing `a` and nothing else.

This differs from `insert a ∅` in that it does not require a `DecidableEq` instance for `α`.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Uniqueness of balanced ternary representation

\leanhelper  If two balanced ternary representations have the same value $n$, then their digit functions are equal. This follows from Lemma~ \ref{lem.fps.laure.sum-powers-three-zero} applied to the difference of the two digit sequences.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.laure.balanced-tern
def.fps.laure.balanced-tern

\leanhelper  A \emph{balanced ternary representation} of an integer $n$ means an essentially finite sequence $\left( b_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}=\left( b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right) \in \left\{  0,1,-1\right\}  ^{\mathbb {N}}$ such that

\[  n=\sum _{i\in \mathbb {N}}b_{i}3^{i}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.laure.binary-rep
def.fps.laure.binary-rep

\leanhelper  A \emph{binary representation} of an integer $n$ means an essentially finite sequence $\left( b_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}=\left( b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right) \in \left\{  0,1\right\}  ^{\mathbb {N}}$ such that

\[  n=\sum _{i\in \mathbb {N}}b_{i}2^{i}.  \]

 (Recall that “essentially finite” means “all but finitely many $i\in \mathbb {N}$ satisfy $b_{i}=0$”.)

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies over the same integer and two representations, `\u2200 (n : \u2124) (r1 r2 : ...BalancedTernaryRep n)`, and concludes exactly that `r1.digits = r2.digits`. This matches \u201cIf two balanced ternary representations have the same value n, then their digit functions are equal.\u201d The shared index `n` encodes having the same value. Moreover, `BalancedTernaryRep n` faithfully implements the informal definition: its `digits : \u2115 \u2192\u2080 \u2124` are essentially finite, the condition `\u2200 i, digits i \u2208 btDigits` with `btDigits = {-1, 0, 1}` gives the prescribed digit set, and `\u2211 i \u2208 digits.support, digits i * 3 ^ i = n` is the finite-support form of the required sum. The reversed orientation relative to the displayed informal equation `n = \u2211 ...` is immaterial by symmetry of equality. No additional mathematical hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers appear."
