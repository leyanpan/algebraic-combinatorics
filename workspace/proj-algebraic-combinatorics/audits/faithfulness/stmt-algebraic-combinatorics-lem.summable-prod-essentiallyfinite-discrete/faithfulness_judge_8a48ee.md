Docstring: **Claim 7 from tex proof** (discrete case): The family (∏_i p_{i,k_i})_{(k_i) ∈ S^I_fin} is summable.

For discrete K, this follows from the finiteness of T'_n and the helper lemmas above. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF TopologicalSpace
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A topology on `X`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DiscreteTopology
(α : Type u_2) → [t : TopologicalSpace α] → Prop

Docstring: A topological space is discrete if every set is open, that is,
its topology equals the discrete topology `⊥`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A type with a zero element. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero.toOfNat0

{σ : Type u_1} → {R : Type u_2} → [Semiring R] → One (MvPowerSeries σ R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

  {β : Type u_2} →
    [AddCommMonoid α] →
      [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → Prop

Docstring: `Summable f` means that `f` has some (infinite) sum with respect to `L`. Use `tsum` to get the
value. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sigma
{α : Type u} → (α → Type v) → Type (max u v)

Docstring: Dependent pairs, in which the second element's type depends on the value of the first element. The
type `Sigma β` is typically written `Σ a : α, β a` or `(a : α) × β a`.

Although its values are pairs, `Sigma` is sometimes known as the *dependent sum type*, since it is
the type level version of an indexed summation.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

Docstring: The second component of a dependent pair. Its type depends on the first component.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF SummationFilter.unconditional
(β : Type u_2) → SummationFilter β

Docstring: **Unconditional summation**: a function on `β` is said to be *unconditionally summable* if its
partial sums over finite subsets converge with respect to the `atTop` filter. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Filter.Eventually
{α : Type u_1} → (α → Prop) → Filter α → Prop

Docstring: `f.Eventually p` or `∀ᶠ x in f, p x` mean that `{x | p x} ∈ f`. E.g., `∀ᶠ x in atTop, p x`
means that `p` holds true for sufficiently large `x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Filter.cofinite
{α : Type u_2} → Filter α

Docstring: The cofinite filter is the filter of subsets whose complements are finite. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF tprod

  {β : Type u_5} →
    [CommMonoid α] → [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Docstring: `∏' i, f i` is the unconditional product of `f`, if it exists, or 1 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∏'[L] i, f i` is the product of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `1` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional product exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the multiplicative support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice,
to use the product over the multiplicative support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a`
satisfying `HasProd f a`. Similar remarks apply to more general summation filters.)

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.summable-prod-essentiallyFinite-discrete

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Summability of the RHS.)} Under the assumptions of Proposition \ref{prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf} (with discrete $K$), the family $\left(\prod _{i\in I} p_{i,k_i}\right)_{(k_i)\text{ ess.\  fin.}}$ is summable.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin
def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin

\textbf{(a)} A sequence $\left( k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\ldots \right) $ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in \left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  $ satisfy $k_{i}=0$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} A family $\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in I}$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $k_{i}=0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unclear",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies only indirectly: \u201cUnder the assumptions of Proposition \\ref{prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf},\u201d but that proposition and its assumptions are absent. Therefore it is impossible to determine whether the formal hypotheses `(\u2200 (i : I), p i 0 = 1)` and `(Summable fun ik => p ik.fst \u2191ik.snd)` exactly reproduce, weaken, or add to those assumptions. In addition, the inferred index types in `Summable fun ik => ...` and `Summable fun f => ...` are not exposed or defined in the package, so one cannot verify that `f` ranges precisely over the blueprint\u2019s \u201cessentially finite\u201d families. The discrete pointwise topology suggests that base-library `Summable` corresponds to the informal entrywise-essentially-finite notion, but this does not resolve the missing hypotheses and index-domain definitions. A verdict would require the statement of `prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf` and the fully expanded definitions/types of the `ik` and `f` index spaces."
