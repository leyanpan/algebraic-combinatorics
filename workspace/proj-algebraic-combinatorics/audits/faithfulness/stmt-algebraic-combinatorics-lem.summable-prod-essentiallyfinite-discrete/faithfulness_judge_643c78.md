Docstring: **Claim 7 from tex proof** (discrete case): The family (∏_i p_{i,k_i})_{(k_i) ∈ S^I_fin} is summable.

For discrete K, this follows from the finiteness of T'_n and the helper lemmas above.

maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time.

Body:
wrapped✝.1

Docstring: `∏' i, f i` is the unconditional product of `f`, if it exists, or 1 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∏'[L] i, f i` is the product of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `1` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional product exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the multiplicative support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice,
to use the product over the multiplicative support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a`
satisfying `HasProd f a`. Similar remarks apply to more general summation filters.)

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.summable-prod-essentiallyFinite-discrete

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Summability of the RHS.)} Under the assumptions of Proposition \ref{prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf} (with discrete $K$), the family $\left(\prod _{i\in I} p_{i,k_i}\right)_{(k_i)\text{ ess.\  fin.}}$ is summable.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin
def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin

\textbf{(a)} A sequence $\left( k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\ldots \right) $ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in \left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  $ satisfy $k_{i}=0$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} A family $\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in I}$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $k_{i}=0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## INFORMAL CONTEXT stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf
prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf

Let $I$ be a set. For any $i\in I$, let $S_{i}$ be a set that contains the number $0$. Set

\[  \overline{S}=\left\{  \left( i,k\right) \  \mid \  i\in I\text{ and }k\in S_{i}\text{ and }k\neq 0\right\}  .  \]

For any $i\in I$ and any $k\in S_{i}$, let $p_{i,k}$ be an element of $K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $. Assume that 

\begin{equation}  p_{i,0}=1\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for any }i\in I. \end{equation}

 Assume further that the family $\left( p_{i,k}\right) _{\left( i,k\right) \in \overline{S}}$ is summable. Then, the product $\prod _{i\in I}\  \  \sum _{k\in S_{i}}p_{i,k}$ is well-defined (i.e., the family $\left( p_{i,k}\right) _{k\in S_{i}}$ is summable for each $i\in I$, and the family $\left( \sum _{k\in S_{i}}p_{i,k}\right) _{i\in I}$ is multipliable), and we have

\begin{equation}  \prod _{i\in I}\  \  \sum _{k\in S_{i}}p_{i,k}=\sum _{\substack {\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in I}\in \prod _{i\in I}S_{i}\\ \text{is essentially finite}}}\  \  \prod _{i\in I}p_{i,k_{i}}. \end{equation}

 In particular, the family $\left( \prod _{i\in I}p_{i,k_{i}}\right) _{\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in I}\in \prod _{i\in I}S_{i}\text{ is essentially finite}}$ is summable.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "significant_divergence",
  "discrepancies": [
    {
      "root": "(Summable fun ik => p ik.fst \u2191ik.snd)",
      "severity": "significant",
      "bridge": "The formal premise requires summability over every dependent pair `(i,k)` with `k : S i`, including every `(i,0)`. The blueprint assumes summability only over `\\overline S = {(i,k) | k \u2260 0}`. Since the other formal premise says `p i 0 = 1`, for infinite `I` the omitted subfamily consists of infinitely many copies of the nonzero power series `1` and is not summable in the discrete coefficientwise topology. Thus the blueprint assumptions cannot supply the formal premise. Recovering the blueprint claim would require proving the conclusion directly from summability of the nonzero-indexed family, which is the substantive result rather than a routine bridge."
    }
  ],
  "justification": "The target assumes `(Summable fun ik => p ik.fst \u2191ik.snd)`, whose index `ik` ranges over all pairs in `\u03a3 i, S i`. In contrast, Proposition `prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf` assumes that `\u201cthe family (p_{i,k})_{(i,k) \u2208 \\overline S} is summable\u201d`, where `\\overline S` explicitly requires `k \u2260 0`. Together with the shared condition `p_{i,0}=1`, including the zero indices makes the formal hypothesis strictly and generally unattainably stronger for infinite `I`. Therefore the formal theorem does not certify the informal statement under its stated assumptions."
