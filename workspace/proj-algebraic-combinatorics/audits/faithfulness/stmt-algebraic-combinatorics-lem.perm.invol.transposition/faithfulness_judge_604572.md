∀ {X : Type u_1} [inst : DecidableEq X] (i j : X),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution (AlgebraicCombinatorics.transposition i j)

Docstring: Any transposition is an involution. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution (def)
{X : Type u_1} → Equiv.Perm X → Prop

Body:
fun {X} σ => σ * σ = 1

Docstring: A permutation is an involution if `σ ∘ σ = id`. (def.perm.invol)

From the textbook:
> An *involution* of X means a map f: X → X that satisfies f ∘ f = id.
> Clearly, an involution is always a permutation, and equals its own inverse.

Equivalent characterizations:
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ σ * σ = 1` (definition)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ σ⁻¹ = σ` (see `isInvolution_iff_eq_inv`)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ Function.Involutive σ` (see `isInvolution_iff_involutive`)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ ∀ x, σ (σ x) = x` (see `isInvolution_iff_forall`)


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.transposition (def)
{X : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq X] → X → X → Equiv.Perm X

Body:
fun {X} [DecidableEq X] i j => Equiv.swap i j

Docstring: The transposition swapping `i` and `j`. In Mathlib, this is `Equiv.swap i j`.
(def.perm.tij)

A transposition `t_{i,j}` is the permutation of `X` that:
- sends `i` to `j` (see `transposition_apply_left`)
- sends `j` to `i` (see `transposition_apply_right`)
- leaves all other elements unchanged (see `transposition_apply_of_ne_of_ne`) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHMul
{α : Type u_1} → [Mul α] → HMul α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instMul
{α : Type u_4} → Mul (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF One.toOfNat1
{α : Type u_1} → [One α] → OfNat α 1

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instOne
{α : Type u_4} → One (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.swap
{α : Sort u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → α → α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: `swap a b` is the permutation that swaps `a` and `b` and
leaves other values as is. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.invol.transposition

\leanhelper  Any transposition $t_{i,j}$ is an involution.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invol
def.perm.invol

Let $X$ be a set. An \emph{involution} of $X$ means a map $f : X \to X$ that satisfies $f \circ f = \operatorname {id}$. Clearly, an involution is always a permutation, and equals its own inverse.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij
def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint states: \u201cLet i and j be two distinct elements of a set X\u201d and \u201cAny transposition t_{i,j} is an involution.\u201d The target proves `\u2200 {X} [DecidableEq X] (i j : X), IsInvolution (transposition i j)`, without requiring `i \u2260 j`; this is strictly more general, since when `i = j`, `Equiv.swap i j` is the identity and remains an involution. The `[DecidableEq X]` binder is an encoding requirement inherited from `transposition`, whose body is `Equiv.swap i j`, rather than an additional mathematical hypothesis about the claimed transpositions. Finally, `IsInvolution \u03c3` has body `\u03c3 * \u03c3 = 1`, matching the informal condition `f \u2218 f = id` under the stated composition convention."
