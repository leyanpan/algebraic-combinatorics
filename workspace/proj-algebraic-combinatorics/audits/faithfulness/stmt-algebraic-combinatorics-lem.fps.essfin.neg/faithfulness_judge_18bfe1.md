∀ {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] {ι : Type u_2} {f : ι → R},
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite f → AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite fun i => -f i

Docstring: Negation of an essentially finite family is essentially finite.

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite (def)
{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → {ι : Type u_2} → (ι → R) → Prop

Body:
fun {R} [CommRing R] {ι} f => EssentiallyFinite f

Docstring: A family is essentially finite if its support is finite.
(Definition def.infsum.essfin (a))

**This is an alias** for the canonical `EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Neg.neg
{α : Type u} → [self : Neg α] → α → α

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `neg` (when used as a unary operator).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.essfin.neg

\leanhelper  The negation of an essentially finite family is essentially finite.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The target introduces the contentful binder `\u2200 {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R]`, while the blueprint only says, \u201cThe negation of an essentially finite family is essentially finite,\u201d and its definition describes a family in `K^I` without requiring `K` to be a commutative ring. Thus the Lean theorem establishes the claim only for commutative rings, a narrower class than the blueprint states. The restriction also enters through the project alias `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite`, whose signature requires `[CommRing R]`, even though its body delegates to the canonical `EssentiallyFinite`, which requires only `[Zero M]`. On commutative rings the conclusion has the intended meaning, since it says finite support is preserved by pointwise negation. To make the formalization faithful, either the blueprint/context must specify that `K` is a commutative ring, or the alias and theorem must be generalized to a minimal zero-and-negation structure in which `-x = 0` exactly when `x = 0` (for example, an appropriate additive-group setting)."
