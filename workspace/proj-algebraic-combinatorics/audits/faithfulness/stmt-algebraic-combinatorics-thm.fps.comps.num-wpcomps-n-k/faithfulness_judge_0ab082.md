## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.BoundedWeakComposition.card (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n k p : ℕ),
  ↑(Fintype.card (AlgebraicCombinatorics.BoundedWeakComposition n k p)) =
    ∑ j ∈ Finset.range (k + 1) with p * j ≤ n, (-1) ^ j * ↑(k.choose j) * ↑((n - p * j + k - 1).choose (n - p * j))

Docstring: **Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k**:
The number of `k`-tuples `(α₁, α₂, ..., αₖ) ∈ {0, 1, ..., p-1}^k`
satisfying `α₁ + α₂ + ... + αₖ = n` is
`∑_{j : p*j ≤ n} (-1)^j * C(k,j) * C(n - p*j + k - 1, n - p*j)`.

Note: The sum is restricted to `j` with `p * j ≤ n` because when `p * j > n`,
the mathematical binomial coefficient `C(n - p*j + k - 1, n - p*j)` should be 0
(as there are no compositions with negative sum), but `Nat.choose` with truncating
subtraction would give a non-zero value.

## Proof Strategy

The proof uses generating functions. The generating function for bounded weak compositions
is `W_{k,p} = (∑_{i=0}^{p-1} x^i)^k`, which equals `((1-x^p)/(1-x))^k = (1-x^p)^k * (1-x)^{-k}`.

Using binomial expansions:
- `(1-x^p)^k = ∑_{j=0}^k (-1)^j C(k,j) x^{pj}`
- `(1-x)^{-k} = ∑_{m≥0} C(m+k-1, m) x^m`

Convolving these gives the formula.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.BoundedWeakComposition (def)
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → Type

Body:
fun n k p => { α // ∑ i, ↑(α i) = n }

Docstring: A weak composition of `n` into `k` parts with entries bounded by `p`
(i.e., each entry is in `{0, 1, ..., p-1}`).

This is used in Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.BoundedWeakComposition.fintype (def)
(n k p : ℕ) → Fintype (AlgebraicCombinatorics.BoundedWeakComposition n k p)

Body:
fun n k p => Fintype.subtype {α | ∑ i, ↑(α i) = n} ⋯

Docstring: The set of bounded weak compositions is finite.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.card
(α : Type u_4) → [Fintype α] → ℕ

Docstring: `card α` is the number of elements in `α`, defined when `α` is a fintype. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`

{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.choose
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Docstring: `choose n k` is the number of `k`-element subsets in an `n`-element set. Also known as binomial
coefficients. For the fact that this is the number of `k`-element-subsets of an `n`-element
set, see `Finset.card_powersetCard`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instAddCommMonoid
AddCommMonoid ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.subtype
{α : Type u_1} → {p : α → Prop} → (s : Finset α) → (∀ (x : α), x ∈ s ↔ p x) → Fintype { x // p x }

Docstring: Given a predicate that can be represented by a finset, the subtype
associated to the predicate is a fintype.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k

Let $n,k,p\in \mathbb {N}$. Then, the \#  of $k$-tuples $\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{k}\right) \in \left\{  0,1,\ldots ,p-1\right\}  ^{k}$ satisfying $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{k}=n$ is

\[  \sum _{j=0}^{k}\left( -1\right) ^{j}\binom {k}{j}\binom {n-pj+k-1}{n-pj}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies exactly as the blueprint does: `\u2200 (n k p : \u2115)`. By `BoundedWeakComposition n k p := { \u03b1 // \u2211 i, \u2191(\u03b1 i) = n }` and its docstring, `Fintype.card` counts precisely the `k`-tuples with entries in `{0,\u2026,p-1}` whose sum is `n`. The formal sum ranges over `j \u2208 Finset.range (k + 1)` with `p * j \u2264 n`, whereas the blueprint writes `j=0,\u2026,k` without that filter. This restriction does not alter the value under the informal definition of binomial coefficients: if `p*j > n`, the lower argument `n-pj` is not a natural number, so `binom(n-pj+k-1, n-pj) = 0`. For retained terms, natural subtraction agrees with ordinary subtraction; the sole potentially negative upper-argument edge case (`n-pj=0` and `k=0`) also agrees, since both generalized `binom(-1,0)` and `Nat.choose 0 0` equal 1. Casting the finite cardinality and binomial coefficients to `\u2124` correctly accommodates the factors `(-1)^j`. Thus the filtered Lean formula is equivalent to the stated unfiltered formula."
