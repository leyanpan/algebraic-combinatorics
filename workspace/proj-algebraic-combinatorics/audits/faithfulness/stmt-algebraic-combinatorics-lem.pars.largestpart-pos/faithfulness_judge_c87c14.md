## TARGET Nat.Partition.largestPart_pos (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ}, n > 0 → ∀ (p : n.Partition), 0 < p.largestPart

Docstring: For a partition of n > 0, the largest part is positive.
This parallels `largestPart_zero` (for n = 0) and `largestPart_le`.

Since n > 0, the partition has at least one part (by `numParts_pos`),
and all parts are positive (by `parts_pos`). The largest part
(fold max 0) of a non-empty multiset of positive numbers is positive. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.largestPart (def)
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} p => Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts

Docstring: The largest part of a partition (0 for the empty partition).
(Convention \ref{conv.pars.largest-part-0}) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.fold
{α : Type u_1} → (op : α → α → α) → [hc : Std.Commutative op] → [ha : Std.Associative op] → α → Multiset α → α

Docstring: `fold op b s` folds a commutative associative operation `op` over
the multiset `s`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Max.max
{α : Type u} → [self : Max α] → α → α → α

Docstring: Returns the greater of its two arguments. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `max` in identifiers is `max`.

 * The recommended spelling of `⊔` in identifiers is `sup` (`⊔` is the preferred notation for `max` when the type is not linearly ordered.).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.pars.largestPart-pos

\leanhelper  For $n>0$, every partition of $n$ has a positive largest part.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.pars.largest-part-0
conv.pars.largest-part-0

We agree to say that the largest part of the empty partition $\left( {}\right) $ is $0$ (even though this partition has no parts).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The elaborated signature exactly states \u201cFor $n>0$, every partition of $n$ has a positive largest part\u201d: `\u2200 {n : \u2115}, n > 0 \u2192 \u2200 (p : n.Partition), 0 < p.largestPart`. Here `{n : \u2115}` and `n > 0` match \u201cFor $n>0$,\u201d `\u2200 (p : n.Partition)` matches \u201cevery partition of $n$,\u201d and `0 < p.largestPart` matches \u201chas a positive largest part.\u201d The dependency `largestPart` is `Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts`, which computes the maximum part and gives the empty partition value `0`, exactly matching `conv.pars.largest-part-0`. Restricting `n` to `\u2115` does not lose any positive integer cases, since a partition of a positive integer has a natural-number size."
