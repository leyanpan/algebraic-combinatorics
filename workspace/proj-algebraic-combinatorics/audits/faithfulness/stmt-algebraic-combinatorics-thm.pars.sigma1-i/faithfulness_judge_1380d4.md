Docstring: Generalization of the divisor sum recurrence for partitions with parts in a set I:
`n · p_I(n) = ∑_{k=1}^n σ_I(k) · p_I(n-k)`
where σ_I(n) is the sum of divisors of n that belong to I.
(Theorem \ref{thm.pars.sigma1-I})

The proof uses the generating function approach via logarithmic derivatives:
- Let P_I = ∑_n p_I(n) x^n = ∏_{k∈I} 1/(1-x^k)
- Let S_I = ∑_n σ_I(n) x^n
- Taking logarithmic derivative of P_I gives x·P_I'/P_I = S_I
- Therefore x·P_I' = S_I·P_I
- Comparing coefficients of x^n gives the identity

Equivalently, both sides count weighted pairs:
- LHS = ∑_p (sum of parts) = ∑_p ∑_d d·count(d,p)
- RHS = ∑_{m=1}^n σ_I(m)·p_I(n-m) = ∑_d d·∑_{j≥1} p_I(n-d·j)
- Both equal ∑_{d∈I, d≤n} d·∑_{j=1}^{n/d} p_I(n-d·j) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidablePred
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: A decidable predicate.

A predicate is decidable if the corresponding proposition is `Decidable` for each possible argument.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.restricted
(n : ℕ) → (p : ℕ → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset n.Partition

Docstring: The finset of those partitions in which every part satisfies a certain condition. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instAddCommMonoid
AddCommMonoid ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range
ℕ → Finset ℕ

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.divisors
ℕ → Finset ℕ

Docstring: `divisors n` is the `Finset` of divisors of `n`. By convention, we set `divisors 0 = ∅`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
thm.pars.sigma1-I

Let $I$ be a subset of $\left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  $. For each $n\in \mathbb {N}$, let $p_{I}\left( n\right) $ be the \#  of partitions $\lambda $ of $n$ such that all parts of $\lambda $ belong to $I$. 

For any positive integer $n$, let $\sigma _{I}\left( n\right) $ denote the sum of all positive divisors of $n$ that belong to $I$. 

For any $n\in \mathbb {N}$, we have

\[  np_{I}\left( n\right) =\sum _{k=1}^{n}\sigma _{I}\left( k\right) p_{I}\left( n-k\right) .  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binder `\u2200 (I : Set \u2115) ... (\u2200 i \u2208 I, i > 0)` exactly represents \u201cLet I be a subset of {1,2,3,\u2026}\u201d; `[DecidablePred fun x => x \u2208 I]` is only computational encoding needed by `Nat.Partition.restricted` and `Finset.filter`, not a mathematical restriction. By the library definitions, `(Nat.Partition.restricted n fun x => x \u2208 I).card` is precisely the number `p_I(n)` of partitions of `n` all of whose parts lie in `I`. On the right, `k \u2208 Finset.range n` means `k = 0,\u2026,n\u22121`; after reindexing by `m = k+1`, `(\u2211 d \u2208 (k + 1).divisors with d \u2208 I, d)` is `\u03c3_I(m)` and `restricted (n-k-1)` is `p_I(n-m)`. Thus the displayed formal sum is exactly `\u2211_{m=1}^n \u03c3_I(m) p_I(n-m)`. The formal quantifier `\u2200 (n : \u2115)` also matches \u201cFor any n \u2208 \u2115,\u201d including `n = 0`, where both sides are zero."
