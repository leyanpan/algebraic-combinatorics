## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.lehmerCode_mem_lehmerCodeSet (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.lehmerCode σ ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.lehmerCodeSet n

Docstring: The Lehmer code of any permutation lies in H_n.


## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.lehmerCode (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Fin n → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} σ i => AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.lehmerEntry σ i

Docstring: The Lehmer code of σ ∈ S_n is the n-tuple (ℓ_1(σ), ℓ_2(σ), ..., ℓ_n(σ)).

This is the canonical definition using a function type `Fin n → ℕ`.
For the list representation, use `lehmerCode_toList`.

See Definition 1.3.5 (def.perm.lehmer1) part (e) in the source.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.lehmerCodeSet (def)
(n : ℕ) → Set (Fin n → ℕ)

Body:
fun n => {f | ∀ (i : Fin n), f i ≤ n - 1 - ↑i}

Docstring: The set H_n of valid Lehmer codes. An n-tuple (j_1, ..., j_n) is in H_n
if and only if j_i ≤ n - i - 1 for each i ∈ [n].

This is [n-1]_0 × [n-2]_0 × ... × [0]_0.

See Definition 1.3.5 (def.perm.lehmer1) part (c) in the source.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.lehmerEntry (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Fin n → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} σ i => {j | i < j ∧ σ i > σ j}.card

Docstring: For σ ∈ S_n and i ∈ [n], we define ℓ_i(σ) as the number of j > i such that σ(i) > σ(j).
This counts how many elements to the right of position i are smaller than σ(i).

This is the canonical definition of Lehmer entry used throughout the project.
The equivalent formulation `i < j ∧ σ j < σ i` is provided by `lehmerEntry_eq_filter_lt`.

See Definition 1.3.5 (def.perm.lehmer1) part (a) in the source.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd
{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.decLt
{n : ℕ} → (a b : Fin n) → Decidable (a < b)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.perm.lehmer1

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} For each $\sigma \in S_{n}$ and $i\in \left[n\right]$, we set 

\begin{align*}  \ell _{i}\left(\sigma \right) := &  \left(\text{\#  of all }j\in \left[n\right] \text{ satisfying }i<j\text{ and }\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)\right) \\ = &  \left(\text{\#  of all }j\in \left\{ i+1,i+2,\ldots ,n\right\}  \text{ such that }\sigma \left(i\right)>\sigma \left(j\right)\right). \end{align*}

   \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} For each $m\in \mathbb {Z}$, we let $\left[m\right]_{0}$ denote the set $\left\{ 0,1,\ldots ,m\right\} $. (This is an empty set when $m<0$.)   \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} We let $H_{n}$ denote the set 

\begin{align*} &  \left[n-1\right]_{0}\times \left[n-2\right]_{0}\times \cdots \times \left[n-n\right]_{0}\\ &  = \left\{ \left(j_{1},j_{2},\ldots ,j_{n}\right)\in \mathbb {N}^{n} \  \mid \  j_{i}\leq n-i\text{ for each }i\in \left[n\right]\right\} . \end{align*}

 This set $H_{n}$ has size $n!$.   \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Each $\sigma \in S_n$ and each $i\in [n]$ satisfy $\ell _i(\sigma ) \in \{ 0,1,\ldots ,n-i\}  = [n-i]_0$.   \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} We define the map 

\begin{align*}  L:S_{n} & \rightarrow H_{n},\\ \sigma & \mapsto \left(\ell _{1}\left(\sigma \right),\ell _{2}\left( \sigma \right),\ldots ,\ell _{n}\left(\sigma \right)\right). \end{align*}

 If $\sigma \in S_{n}$ is a permutation, then the $n$-tuple $L\left(\sigma \right)$ is called the \emph{Lehmer code} (or just the \emph{code}) of $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "Expanding the formal conclusion `lehmerCode \u03c3 \u2208 lehmerCodeSet n` gives `\u2200 i : Fin n, lehmerEntry \u03c3 i \u2264 n - 1 - \u2191i`. The entry is exactly `{j | i < j \u2227 \u03c3 i > \u03c3 j}.card`, matching the blueprint\u2019s count of positions to the right with smaller values. Lean uses zero-based `Fin n`; under the order-preserving correspondence between formal index `i : Fin n` and the blueprint\u2019s one-based index `i+1 \u2208 [n]`, the formal bound `n - 1 - \u2191i` is the blueprint bound `n - (i+1)`. Thus the theorem establishes precisely that every coordinate of the Lehmer code lies in `H_n`, making the map in part (e) well-defined. `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` faithfully represents permutations of an ordered n-element set, with no added hypotheses or restricted quantifiers."
