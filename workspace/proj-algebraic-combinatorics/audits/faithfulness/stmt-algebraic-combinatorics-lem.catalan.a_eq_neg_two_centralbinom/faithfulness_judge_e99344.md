## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.A_eq_neg_two_centralBinom (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n : ℕ), Ring.choose (1 / 2) (n + 1) * (-4) ^ (n + 1) * (↑n + 1) = -2 * ↑n.centralBinom

Docstring: Key identity: $\binom{1/2}{n+1} \cdot (-4)^{n+1} \cdot (n+1) = -2 \cdot \binom{2n}{n}$.

This relates the binomial coefficient at 1/2 to the central binomial coefficient. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Rat.instDiv
Div ℚ

Docstring: Division of rational numbers. Note: `div a 0 = 0`.  Written with a separate function `Rat.div`
as a wrapper so that the definition is not unfolded at `.instance` transparency. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `neg` (when used as a unary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.centralBinom

Docstring: The central binomial coefficient, `Nat.choose (2 * n) n`.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.catalan.A_eq_neg_two_centralBinom

\leanhelper  For $n\in \mathbb {N}$, $\binom {1/2}{n+1}\cdot (-4)^{n+1}\cdot (n+1) = -2\cdot \binom {2n}{n}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies \u201cFor $n\\in\\mathbb N$,\u201d and the Lean signature has exactly `\u2200 (n : \u2115)`. Its left side, `Ring.choose (1 / 2) (n + 1) * (-4) ^ (n + 1) * (\u2191n + 1)`, is the rational-valued generalized binomial coefficient $\\binom{1/2}{n+1}$ multiplied by $(-4)^{n+1}(n+1)$. Its right side, `-2 * \u2191n.centralBinom`, is $-2$ times the cast of `Nat.centralBinom n`, whose docstring defines it as `Nat.choose (2 * n) n`, namely $\\binom{2n}{n}$. There are no additional hypotheses or restricted quantifiers, so the formal equality matches the informal statement."
