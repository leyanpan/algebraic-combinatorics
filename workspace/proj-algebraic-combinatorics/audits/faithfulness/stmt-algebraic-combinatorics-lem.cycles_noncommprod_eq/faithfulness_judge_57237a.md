## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.CycleDecomposition.cycles (def)
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → Equiv.Perm α → Finset (Equiv.Perm α)

Body:
fun {α} [DecidableEq α] [Fintype α] σ => σ.cycleFactorsFinset

Docstring: The cycles of a permutation σ are the elements of `σ.cycleFactorsFinset`.
Each cycle is a permutation that is a cycle in the graph-theoretic sense.

Note: This only includes cycles of length ≥ 2 (non-trivial cycles).
Fixed points (1-cycles) are not included, following Mathlib's convention.
See `numCyclesTotal` for the total count including 1-cycles.

Docstring: The cycles of σ pairwise commute (since they are disjoint). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

{α : Type u_3} →
  {β : Type u_4} → [inst : Monoid β] → (s : Finset α) → (f : α → β) → (↑s).Pairwise (Function.onFun Commute f) → β

Docstring: Product of a `s : Finset α` mapped with `f : α → β` with `[Monoid β]`,
given a proof that `*` commutes on all elements `f x` for `x ∈ s`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DivInvMonoid.toMonoid

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.permGroup
{α : Type u_4} → Group (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF id
{α : Sort u} → α → α

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.cycleFactorsFinset
{α : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → Equiv.Perm α → Finset (Equiv.Perm α)

Docstring: Factors a permutation `f` into a `Finset` of disjoint cyclic permutations that multiply to `f`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Pairwise
{α : Type u_1} → Set α → (α → α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: The relation `r` holds pairwise on the set `s` if `r x y` for all *distinct* `x y ∈ s`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SetLike.coe
{A : Type u_1} → {B : outParam (Type u_2)} → [self : SetLike A B] → A → Set B

Docstring: The coercion from a term of a `SetLike` to its corresponding `Set`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSetLike
{α : Type u_1} → SetLike (Finset α) α

Docstring: Convert a finset to a set in the natural way. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Commute
{S : Type u_3} → [Mul S] → S → S → Prop

Docstring: Two elements commute if `a * b = b * a`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.cycles_noncommProd_eq

\leanhelper  The product of the cycles of $\sigma $ (in any order, since they commute) equals $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.dcdlisttoperm
def.dcdListToPerm

\leanhelper  Given a list of lists (each representing a cycle), the corresponding permutation is obtained by composing the cycle permutations $\operatorname {cyc}_{a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m}$ for each list $(a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m)$ in the input.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs
def.perm.cycs

Let $X$ be a set. Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k$ be $k$ distinct elements of $X$. Then, 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}  \]

 means the permutation of $X$ that sends 

\begin{align*} & i_1 \text{ to } i_2, \\ & i_2 \text{ to } i_3, \\ & \ldots , \\ & i_{k-1} \text{ to } i_k, \\ & i_k \text{ to } i_1 \end{align*}

 and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged. In other words, $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}$ means the permutation of $X$ that satisfies 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, \ldots , i_k}(p) = \begin{cases}  i_{j+1}, &  \text{if } p = i_j \text{ for some } j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} ;\\ p, &  \text{otherwise} \end{cases}  \]

 for every $p \in X$, where $i_{k+1}$ means $i_1$. 

This permutation is called a $k$\emph{-cycle}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs.cycs
def.perm.cycs.cycs

Let $X$ be a finite set. Let $\sigma $ be a permutation of $X$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{cycles} of $\sigma $ are defined to be the cycles in the DCD of $\sigma $ (as defined in Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} \textbf{(a)}). (This includes $1$-cycles, if there are any in the DCD of $\sigma $.) 

We shall equate a cycle of $\sigma $ with any of its cyclic rotations; thus, for example, $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 1,4,3\right) $ shall be regarded as being the same cycle (but $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 3,4,1\right) $ shall not). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{cycle lengths partition} of $\sigma $ shall denote the partition of $\left\vert X\right\vert $ obtained by writing down the lengths of the cycles of $\sigma $ in weakly decreasing order.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.notations
def.perm.notations

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_n$. We introduce three notations for $\sigma $: 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{two-line notation} of $\sigma $ means a $2 \times n$-array 

\[  \begin{pmatrix}  p_1 

&  p_2 

&  \cdots 

&  p_n 

\\ \sigma (p_1) 

&  \sigma (p_2) 

&  \cdots 

&  \sigma (p_n) 

\end{pmatrix},  \]

 where the entries $p_1, p_2, \ldots , p_n$ of the top row are the $n$ elements of $[n]$ in some order. Commonly, we pick $p_i = i$. 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{one-line notation} (short, \emph{OLN}) of $\sigma $ means the $n$-tuple $(\sigma (1), \sigma (2), \ldots , \sigma (n))$. 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{cycle digraph} of $\sigma $ is the directed graph with vertices $1, 2, \ldots , n$ and arcs $i \to \sigma (i)$ for all $i \in [n]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target states `\u2200 {\u03b1 : Type u_1} [DecidableEq \u03b1] [Fintype \u03b1] (\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1), (cycles \u03c3).noncommProd id \u22ef = \u03c3`, matching \u201cThe product of the cycles of \u03c3 (in any order, since they commute) equals \u03c3.\u201d The supplied argument `\u22ef` to `Finset.noncommProd` certifies pairwise commutativity, as required by its signature and provided by `cycles_mem_commute`. Although the project definition `cycles \u03c3 := \u03c3.cycleFactorsFinset` omits 1-cycles while the informal definition explicitly includes them, every 1-cycle is the identity permutation by `def.perm.cycs`; inserting or removing such factors does not change the product. Thus the formal equality for the nontrivial cycles implies the stated equality for all cycles. `[Fintype \u03b1]` expresses the blueprint\u2019s finite-set setting, and `[DecidableEq \u03b1]` is computational structure needed for the finset representation rather than a mathematically substantive restriction."
