Docstring: Renaming variables in a filling monomial equals applying the permutation to entries. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SkewFilling (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Type

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => { c // c ∈ skewYoungDiagram lam mu } → Fin N

Docstring: The type of all fillings of a skew diagram with entries in Fin N.
This is finite since the diagram is finite and Fin N is finite. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY fillingMonomial (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → {lam mu : NPartition N} → SkewFilling lam mu → MvPolynomial (Fin N) ℤ

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] {lam mu} f => ∏ c, MvPolynomial.X (f c)

Docstring: The monomial associated to a filling.
x_f = ∏_{c ∈ Y(λ/μ)} x_{f(c)} 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY applyPermToFilling (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → {lam mu : NPartition N} → Equiv.Perm (Fin N) → SkewFilling lam mu → SkewFilling lam mu

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] {lam mu} σ f c => σ (f c)

Docstring: Applying a permutation σ to each entry of a filling. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => lam.youngDiagram \ mu.youngDiagram

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is the set difference Y(λ) \ Y(μ).
Definition \ref{def.sf.skew-diag} in the source.

**Note**: This is a duplicate of `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` that requires `[NeZero N]`.
Prefer `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` for new code as it works for all `N`.

For N-partitions λ and μ with μ ⊆ λ, the skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is defined as:
```
Y(λ) \ Y(μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ [λ_i] \ [μ_i]}
            = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ ℤ and μ_i < j ≤ λ_i}
```
(The second form uses 1-indexed j as in the textbook.)

In our 0-indexed formalization, this becomes:
```
Y(λ/μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ Fin N and μ_i ≤ j < λ_i}
```

Example: Y((4,3,1)/(2,1,0)) consists of cells:
- Row 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)  (since μ₀ = 2, λ₀ = 4)
- Row 1: (1, 1), (1, 2)  (since μ₁ = 1, λ₁ = 3)
- Row 2: (2, 0)          (since μ₂ = 0, λ₂ = 1) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.youngDiagram (def)

Body:
fun {N} μ => Finset.univ.biUnion fun i => Finset.map { toFun := fun j => (i, j), inj' := ⋯ } (Finset.range (μ.parts i))

Docstring: The Young diagram Y(λ) of an N-partition λ is the set of cells (i, j) where
i ∈ Fin N and j < λ_i.
Definition def.sf.ydiag in the source.

Note: Mathlib has `YoungDiagram` which is more general (infinite diagrams).
Here we define a version specific to N-partitions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF NeZero
{R : Type u_1} → [Zero R] → R → Prop

Docstring: A type-class version of `n ≠ 0`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instPreorder

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.rename-filling-monomial

\leanhelper  Renaming variables in a filling monomial equals applying the permutation to each entry: 

\[  \mathrm{rename}(\sigma )(x_f) = x_{\sigma \circ f}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.filling
def.sf.filling

\leanhelper  A \emph{filling} of a skew Young diagram $Y(\lambda /\mu )$ is a function $f : Y(\lambda /\mu ) \to [N]$. A filling is \emph{semistandard} if it satisfies the row-weak and column-strict conditions. The \emph{filling monomial} is $x_f = \prod _{c \in Y(\lambda /\mu )} x_{f(c)}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar-skewyoungdiagram
def.sf.Npar-skewYoungDiagram

\leanhelper  The \emph{skew Young diagram} $Y(\lambda /\mu )$ for $N$-partitions $\lambda , \mu $ is the set difference $Y(\lambda ) \setminus Y(\mu )$, consisting of cells $(i, j)$ with $\mu _i \leq j < \lambda _i$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar-youngdiagram
def.sf.Npar-youngDiagram

\leanhelper  The \emph{Young diagram} $Y(\lambda )$ of an $N$-partition $\lambda $ is the finite set of cells 

\[  Y(\lambda ) = \{ (i, j) : i \in [N],\;  0 \leq j < \lambda _i\} .  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-ssyt
def.sf.skew-ssyt

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. 

A Young tableau $T$ of shape $\lambda /\mu $ is said to be \emph{semistandard} if its entries 

\begin{itemize} \item increase weakly along each row (from left to right); 

\item increase strictly down each column (from top to bottom). 

\end{itemize}

Formally speaking, this means that a Young tableau $T:Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $ is semistandard if and only if 

\begin{itemize} \item we have $T\left( i,j\right) \leq T\left( i,j+1\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ satisfying $\left( i,j+1\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $; 

\item we have $T\left( i,j\right) <T\left( i+1,j\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ satisfying $\left( i+1,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $. 

\end{itemize}

We let $\operatorname *{SSYT}\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ denote the set of all semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-tab
def.sf.skew-tab

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions such that $\mu \subseteq \lambda $. A \emph{Young tableau} of shape $\lambda /\mu $ means a way of filling the boxes of $Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ with elements of $\left[ N\right] $ (one element per box). Formally speaking, it is defined as a map $T:Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $. 

Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $ are often called \emph{skew Young tableaux}. 

If we don’t have $\mu \subseteq \lambda $, then we agree that there are no Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ytab.skew-xt
def.sf.ytab.skew-xT

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. If $T$ is any Young tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $, then we define the corresponding monomial

\[  x_{T}:=\prod _{c\text{ is a box of }Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) }x_{T\left( c\right) }=\prod _{\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) }x_{T\left( i,j\right) }=\prod _{k=1}^{N}x_{k}^{\left( \text{\#  of times }k\text{ appears in }T\right) }.  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The formal theorem quantifies only over `\u2200 {N : \u2115} [inst : NeZero N] ...`, whereas the blueprint states the identity for a filling and permutation without requiring `N \u2260 0`; its convention explicitly uses `Fin n = {0, \u2026, n-1}`, which also makes sense for `n = 0`. Thus the typeclass binder narrows the quantified range and is a contentful added hypothesis. This restriction enters through the dependency `SkewFilling : {N : \u2115} \u2192 [NeZero N] \u2192 ...` (and consequently `fillingMonomial`, `applyPermToFilling`, and the duplicate `skewYoungDiagram`), not through the algebraic identity itself. Apart from that restriction, `MvPolynomial.rename \u21d1\u03c3` sends each factor `X (f c)` to `X (\u03c3 (f c))`, exactly matching `x_{\u03c3 \u2218 f}` via `applyPermToFilling \u03c3 f c := \u03c3 (f c)`. To make the declaration faithful, remove `[NeZero N]` from `SkewFilling` and the dependent definitions/theorem, using the all-`N` skew-diagram definition mentioned in the package."
