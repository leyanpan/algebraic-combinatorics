Docstring: **Theorem `thm.pie.2`**: The weighted version of the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion.

For a finite type `U`, finitely many subsets `A₁, ..., Aₙ` (indexed by a finite type `ι`),
an additive abelian group `G`, and a weight function `w : U → G`:

  ∑_{u ∈ U : u ∉ Aᵢ for all i} w(u) = ∑_{I ⊆ ι} (-1)^|I| ∑_{u ∈ U : u ∈ Aᵢ for all i ∈ I} w(u)

This generalizes the size version (Theorem `thm.pie.1`) which is obtained by taking `w(u) = 1`.

The left-hand side sums `w(u)` over all elements `u` that belong to none of the subsets `Aᵢ`.
The right-hand side is an alternating sum over all subsets `I` of the index set, where we sum
`w(u)` over elements belonging to all `Aᵢ` with `i ∈ I`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF AddCommGroup
Type u → Type u

Docstring: An additive commutative group is an additive group with commutative `(+)`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Compl.compl
{α : Type u_1} → [self : Compl α] → α → α

Docstring: Set / lattice complement

## BASE-LIBRARY REF BooleanAlgebra.toCompl
{α : Type u} → [self : BooleanAlgebra α] → Compl α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.powerset
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → Finset (Finset α)

Docstring: When `s` is a finset, `s.powerset` is the finset of all subsets of `s` (seen as finsets). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSMul.hSMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a • b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent, but it is intended to be used for left actions. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `•` in identifiers is `smul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

Docstring: `a ^ b` computes `a` to the power of `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `^` in identifiers is `pow`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Neg.neg
{α : Type u} → [self : Neg α] → α → α

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `neg` (when used as a unary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instNegInt
Neg ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Weighted version of the PIE

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$, and let $U$ be a finite set. Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n$ be $n$ subsets of $U$. Let $G$ be any additive abelian group. Let $w\colon U \to G$ be any map. Then, 

\[  \sum _{\substack {u \in U \\ u \notin A_i \text{ for all } i \in [n]}} w(u) = \sum _{I \subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|I|} \sum _{\substack {u \in U \\ u \in A_i \text{ for all } i \in I}} w(u).  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal binders `[Fintype \u03b9] ... [Fintype U] ... [AddCommGroup G] (A : \u03b9 \u2192 Finset U) (w : U \u2192 G)` faithfully represent a finite family of subsets of a finite universe, an additive abelian group, and a weight map. The left side `\u2211 u \u2208 Finset.univ.inf fun i => (A i)\u1d9c, w u` sums over the intersection of all complements, matching \u201cu \u2209 A_i for all i \u2208 [n]\u201d. The right side ranges over `Finset.univ.powerset`, i.e. all subsets `I` of the index set, and uses `(-1) ^ I.card \u2022 \u2211 u \u2208 I.inf A, w u`, matching the alternating coefficient and intersection condition. Quantifying over an arbitrary finite index type `\u03b9` is strictly more general than indexing by `[n]`, so it is faithful. The `DecidableEq` binders are computational encoding needed for `Finset` operations, not mathematically substantive restrictions."
