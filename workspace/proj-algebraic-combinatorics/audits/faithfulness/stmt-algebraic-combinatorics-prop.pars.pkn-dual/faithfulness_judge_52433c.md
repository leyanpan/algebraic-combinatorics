## TARGET Nat.Partition.partsCount_eq_largestPartCount (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n k : ℕ), Nat.Partition.partsCount k n = {p | p.largestPart = k}.card

Docstring: The number of partitions of n into k parts equals the number of partitions
of n whose largest part is k.
(Proposition \ref{prop.pars.pkn=dual})

This follows from the fact that transpose is a bijection that swaps
"number of parts" with "largest part". 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.partsCount (def)
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun k n => {p | p.parts.card = k}.card

Docstring: The function `p_k(n)`: the number of partitions of `n` into exactly `k` parts.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pn-pkn} (a)) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.largestPart (def)
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} p => Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts

Docstring: The largest part of a partition (0 for the empty partition).
(Convention \ref{conv.pars.largest-part-0}) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.instFintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype n.Partition

Docstring: Show there are finitely many partitions by considering the surjection from compositions to
partitions.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Multiset α → ℕ

Docstring: The cardinality of a multiset is the sum of the multiplicities
of all its elements, or simply the length of the underlying list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.parts
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → Multiset ℕ

Docstring: positive integers summing to `n` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.fold
{α : Type u_1} → (op : α → α → α) → [hc : Std.Commutative op] → [ha : Std.Associative op] → α → Multiset α → α

Docstring: `fold op b s` folds a commutative associative operation `op` over
the multiset `s`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Max.max
{α : Type u} → [self : Max α] → α → α → α

Docstring: Returns the greater of its two arguments. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `max` in identifiers is `max`.

 * The recommended spelling of `⊔` in identifiers is `sup` (`⊔` is the preferred notation for `max` when the type is not linearly ordered.).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.pars.pkn=dual

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. Then,

\[  p_{k}\left( n\right) =\left( \text{\#  of partitions of }n\text{ whose largest part is }k\right) .  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies exactly as the blueprint does: `\u2200 (n k : \u2115)`. Its left side is `Nat.Partition.partsCount k n`, whose body is `{p | p.parts.card = k}.card`, exactly the number `p_k(n)` of partitions of `n` into `k` parts. Its right side is `{p | p.largestPart = k}.card`; over the finite type `n.Partition`, this is the number of partitions of `n` whose largest part is `k`. The dependency `largestPart` is `Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts`, matching the intended largest part, including the empty partition convention. Thus the formal equality states precisely the informal proposition, with no added hypotheses or restricted quantifiers."
