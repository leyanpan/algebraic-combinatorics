## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{X : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq X] → List X → Equiv.Perm X

Body:
fun {X} [DecidableEq X] l => l.formPerm

Docstring: The k-cycle `cyc_{i₁, i₂, ..., iₖ}` is the permutation that sends
`i₁ ↦ i₂ ↦ i₃ ↦ ... ↦ iₖ ↦ i₁` and fixes all other elements.
(def.perm.cycs)

This is the constructive definition from the textbook. In Mathlib,
this is `List.formPerm`. 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc_apply_of_not_mem (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {X : Type u_1} [inst : DecidableEq X] {l : List X} {x : X}, x ∉ l → (AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc l) x = x

Docstring: The cycle applied to an element not in the list returns the element unchanged.
This is the "otherwise" case in def.perm.cycs. 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc_apply_getElem (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {X : Type u_1} [inst : DecidableEq X] {l : List X},
  l.Nodup → ∀ (j : ℕ) (hj : j < l.length), (AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc l) l[j] = l[(j + 1) % l.length]

Docstring: The cycle sends `l[j]` to `l[(j+1) % l.length]` for a nodup list.
This is the formal statement of def.perm.cycs from the textbook:
"cyc_{i₁,...,iₖ}(p) = i_{j+1} if p = i_j for some j ∈ {1,...,k}" 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.formPerm
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → List α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: A list `l : List α` can be interpreted as an `Equiv.Perm α` where each element in the list
is permuted to the next one, defined as `formPerm`. When we have that `Nodup l`,
we prove that `Equiv.Perm.support (formPerm l) = l.toFinset`, and that
`formPerm l` is rotationally invariant, in `formPerm_rotate`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (List α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function.

{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.Nodup
{α : Type u} → List α → Prop

Docstring: The list has no duplicates: it contains every element at most once.

It is defined as `Pairwise (· ≠ ·)`: each element is unequal to all other elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GetElem.getElem
{coll : Type u} →
  {idx : Type v} →
    {elem : outParam (Type w)} →
      {valid : outParam (coll → idx → Prop)} →
        [self : GetElem coll idx elem valid] → (xs : coll) → (i : idx) → valid xs i → elem

Docstring: The syntax `arr[i]` gets the `i`'th element of the collection `arr`. If there
are proof side conditions to the application, they will be automatically
inferred by the `get_elem_tactic` tactic.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMod.hMod
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMod α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a % b` computes the remainder upon dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For `Nat` and `Int` it satisfies `a % b + b * (a / b) = a`,
  and `a % 0` is defined to be `a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `%` in identifiers is `mod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.perm.cycs

Let $X$ be a set. Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k$ be $k$ distinct elements of $X$. Then, 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}  \]

 means the permutation of $X$ that sends 

\begin{align*} & i_1 \text{ to } i_2, \\ & i_2 \text{ to } i_3, \\ & \ldots , \\ & i_{k-1} \text{ to } i_k, \\ & i_k \text{ to } i_1 \end{align*}

 and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged. In other words, $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}$ means the permutation of $X$ that satisfies 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, \ldots , i_k}(p) = \begin{cases}  i_{j+1}, &  \text{if } p = i_j \text{ for some } j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} ;\\ p, &  \text{otherwise} \end{cases}  \]

 for every $p \in X$, where $i_{k+1}$ means $i_1$. 

This permutation is called a $k$\emph{-cycle}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint assumes \u201ci\u2081, i\u2082, \u2026, i\u2096 [are] k distinct elements,\u201d which is represented by `l.Nodup` in `cyc_apply_getElem`. Its conclusion, `(cyc l) l[j] = l[(j + 1) % l.length]` for `j < l.length`, is exactly the zero-based version of sending each `i_j` to `i_{j+1}`, with reduction modulo `l.length` implementing `i_{k+1} = i\u2081`. The other case is supplied by `cyc_apply_of_not_mem`: `x \u2209 l \u2192 (cyc l) x = x`, matching \u201cleaves all other elements of X unchanged.\u201d Finally, `cyc l : Equiv.Perm X` has the blueprint meaning of a permutation as a bijection `X \u2192 X`. Although the definition `cyc` accepts lists without `Nodup`, this is a harmless extension beyond the blueprint\u2019s domain; the claimed behavior on distinct entries is stated under `l.Nodup`. The binder `[DecidableEq X]` is a constructive implementation requirement needed by `List.formPerm`, rather than a mathematical alteration of the cycle characterization."
