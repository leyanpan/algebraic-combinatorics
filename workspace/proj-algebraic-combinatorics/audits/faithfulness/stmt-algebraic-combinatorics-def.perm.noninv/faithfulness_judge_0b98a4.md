## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Perm.nonInv (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Finset (Fin n × Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ => {p | p.1 < p.2 ∧ σ p.1 < σ p.2}

Docstring: The non-inversions of a permutation σ: pairs (i, j) with i < j and σ i < σ j.

This is the complement of `inv σ` within the set of ordered pairs.
The non-inversions are exactly the pairs where σ preserves the order.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd
{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.decLt
{n : ℕ} → (a b : Fin n) → Decidable (a < b)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instFintypeProd
(α : Type u_4) → (β : Type u_5) → [Fintype α] → [Fintype β] → Fintype (α × β)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.perm.nonInv

\leanhelper  The \emph{non-inversions} of a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ are the pairs $(i,j)$ with $i < j$ and $\sigma (i) < \sigma (j)$. These are exactly the ordered pairs that are not inversions. The inversions and non-inversions partition the set of all $\binom {n}{2}$ ordered pairs.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The body `fun {n} \u03c3 => {p | p.1 < p.2 \u2227 \u03c3 p.1 < \u03c3 p.2}` defines exactly the pairs described informally as \u201cpairs `(i,j)` with `i < j` and `\u03c3(i) < \u03c3(j)`.\u201d The binders `{n : \u2115} \u2192 Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` faithfully encode `\u03c3 \u2208 S_n`: `Equiv.Perm` is a bijection from a type to itself, and `Fin n` is the canonical ordered `n`-element type. Using `Fin n = {0,\u2026,n\u22121}` rather than the blueprint\u2019s `[n] = {1,\u2026,n}` is only an order-preserving reindexing and does not change the notion of non-inversion. The explanatory partition claim is also consistent: injectivity of a permutation ensures that for each pair with `i < j`, exactly one of `\u03c3 i < \u03c3 j` and `\u03c3 i > \u03c3 j` holds."
