## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.coeff_X_mul_deriv_pentagonal_match (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n : ℕ),
  (PowerSeries.coeff n) (PowerSeries.X * (PowerSeries.derivative ℤ) AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalSeries) =
    match AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumberInverse n with
    | some k => (-1) ^ k.natAbs * ↑n
    | none => 0

Docstring: Express the coefficient of x * Q' in terms of pentagonalNumberInverse.
The coefficient is (-1)^|k| * n if n = w_k for some k, and 0 otherwise. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalSeries (def)
{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → PowerSeries R

Body:
fun {R} [CommRing R] => PowerSeries.mk fun n => ↑(AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalCoeff n)

Docstring: The alternating sum ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k} as a formal power series.
This is well-defined because the pentagonal numbers grow quadratically.

We define the coefficient at n to be (-1)^k if n = w_k for some k, and 0 otherwise.
Since pentagonal numbers are injective, this is well-defined. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumberInverse (def)
ℕ → Option ℤ

Body:
fun n =>
  have bound := n + 1;
  have posResult :=
    List.find? (fun k => decide (AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber k = n)) do
      let a ← List.range bound
      pure ↑a;
  match posResult with
  | some k => some k
  | none =>
    have negResult :=
      List.find? (fun k => decide (AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber (-k - 1) = n)) do
        let a ← List.range bound
        pure ↑a;
    match negResult with
    | some k => some (-k - 1)
    | none => none

Docstring: Helper: Check if n is a pentagonal number and return the corresponding k.
Returns none if n is not a pentagonal number.

This is computable for any given n by checking a finite range of k values,
since pentagonal numbers grow quadratically. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalCoeff (def)
ℕ → ℤ

Body:
fun n =>
  match AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumberInverse n with
  | some k => (-1) ^ k.natAbs
  | none => 0

Docstring: The coefficient of x^n in the pentagonal series.
Returns (-1)^k if n = w_k for some k, and 0 otherwise.

Note: We use `k.natAbs` to compute the sign correctly for negative k,
since (-1)^k = (-1)^|k| for integers (as (-1)^{-m} = (-1)^m). 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber (def)
ℤ → ℕ

Body:
fun k => ((3 * k - 1) * k / 2).toNat

Docstring: The k-th pentagonal number, defined as w_k = (3k - 1) * k / 2.
This is always a nonnegative integer for any k ∈ ℤ.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pent-num}) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

                [inst_3 : AddCommMonoid M₂] → [_root_.Module R M] → [_root_.Module S M₂] → Type (max u_16 u_17)

Docstring: A map `f` between an `R`-module and an `S`-module over a ring homomorphism `σ : R →+* S`
is semilinear if it satisfies the two properties `f (x + y) = f x + f y` and
`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPowerSeries.instMul
{σ : Type u_1} → {R : Type u_2} → [Semiring R] → Mul (MvPowerSeries σ R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

          [inst_2 : AddCommMonoid M] → [Algebra R A] → [_root_.Module A M] → [_root_.Module R M] → Type (max u_2 u_3)

Docstring: `D : Derivation R A M` is an `R`-linear map from `A` to `M` that satisfies the `leibniz`
equality. We also require that `D 1 = 0`. See `Derivation.mk'` for a constructor that deduces this
assumption from the Leibniz rule when `M` is cancellative.

type, it can also represent partiality.

Mul ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HPow.hPow
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HPow α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a ^ b` computes `a` to the power of `b`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instNegInt
Neg ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.natAbs
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: The absolute value of an integer is its distance from `0`.

This function is overridden by the compiler with an efficient implementation. This definition is
the logical model.

Examples:

 * `(0 : Int).natAbs = 0`
 * `(-11 : Int).natAbs = 11`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.cast
{R : Type u} → [IntCast R] → ℤ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Int → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a ring structure,
and this homomorphism should be a ring homomorphism.

`IntCast` and `NatCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.

such element is found.

`O(|l|)`.

Examples:
* `[7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].find? (· < 5) = some 1`
* `[7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].find? (· < 1) = none`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable.decide
(p : Prop) → [h : Decidable p] → Bool

Docstring: Converts a decidable proposition into a `Bool`.

that is `true` if `p` is true and `false` if `p` is false.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Bind.bind
{m : Type u → Type v} → [self : Bind m] → {α β : Type u} → m α → (α → m β) → m β

Docstring: Sequences two computations, allowing the second to depend on the value computed by the first.

If `x : m α` and `f : α → m β`, then `x >>= f : m β` represents the result of executing `x` to get
a value of type `α` and then passing it to `f`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>>=` in identifiers is `bind`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Monad.toBind
{m : Type u → Type v} → [self : Monad m] → Bind m

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.instMonad
Monad List

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.range

Docstring: Returns a list of the numbers from `0` to `n` exclusive, in increasing order.

`O(n)`.

Examples:
* `range 5 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
* `range 0 = []`
* `range 2 = [0, 1]`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Pure.pure
{f : Type u → Type v} → [self : Pure f] → {α : Type u} → α → f α

Docstring: Given `a : α`, then `pure a : f α` represents an action that does nothing and returns `a`.

Examples:
* `(pure "hello" : Option String) = some "hello"`
* `(pure "hello" : Except (Array String) String) = Except.ok "hello"`
* `(pure "hello" : StateM Nat String).run 105 = ("hello", 105)`

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

Docstring: No value. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.toNat

Docstring: Converts an integer into a natural number. Negative numbers are converted to `0`.

Examples:
* `(7 : Int).toNat = 7`
* `(0 : Int).toNat = 0`
* `(-7 : Int).toNat = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHDiv
{α : Type u_1} → [Div α] → HDiv α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDiv
Div ℤ

Docstring: The `Div Int` and `Mod Int` instances use `Int.ediv` and `Int.emod` for compatibility with SMT-LIB and
because mathematical reasoning tends to be easier.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.jtp.coeff-X-mul-deriv-pentagonal-match

\leanhelper  The $n$-th coefficient of $xQ'$ is determined by pentagonal numbers: 

\[  [x^n](xQ') = \begin{cases}  (-1)^{|k|}\cdot n &  \text{if } n = w_k \text{ for some } k\in \mathbb {Z}, \\ 0 &  \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}  \]

 This follows from $xQ' = \sum _{k\in \mathbb {Z}} (-1)^k w_k x^{w_k}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.ismultipliable
def.fps.lim.isMultipliable

\leanhelper  A family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ of FPSs is \emph{multipliable} if (1) $[x^0]f_i = 1$ for all $i$, and (2) for each $n \in \mathbb {N}$, there exists $N$ such that for all $i \geq N$ and all $k \leq n$, $[x^k]f_i = \delta _{k,0}$ (i.e., eventually all $f_i$ are $\equiv 1 \pmod{x^{n+1}}$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.tprod
def.fps.lim.tprod

\leanhelper  The \emph{infinite product} of a multipliable family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ is the FPS $\prod _{n \in \mathbb {N}} f_n$ whose $n$-th coefficient equals $[x^n](\prod _{j=0}^{N} f_j)$ for any sufficiently large $N$.

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.xneq
def.fps.xneq

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $f,g\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ be two FPSs. We write $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$ if and only if 

\[  \text{each }m\in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots ,n\right\} \text{ satisfies } \left[x^{m}\right]f=\left[x^{m}\right]g.  \]

Thus, we have defined a binary relation $\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }$ on the set $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$. We say that an FPS $f$ is $x^{n}$\emph{-equivalent} to an FPS $g$ if and only if $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.pent-num
def.pars.pent-num

For any $k\in \mathbb {Z}$, define a nonnegative integer $w_{k}\in \mathbb {N}$ by 

\[  w_{k}=\frac{\left( 3k-1\right) k}{2}.  \]

 This is called the $k$\emph{-th pentagonal number}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pent.coeff
def.pent.coeff

\leanhelper  The \emph{pentagonal coefficient} at $n\in \mathbb {N}$ is 

\[  \mathrm{pentagonalCoeff}(n) = \begin{cases}  (-1)^{|k|} &  \text{if } n = w_k \text{ for some } k\in \mathbb {Z}, \\ 0 &  \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}  \]

 This is well-defined by the injectivity of pentagonal numbers (Lemma~ \ref{lem.pent.injective}).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pent.eulerproduct
def.pent.eulerProduct

\leanhelper  The \emph{Euler product} is the infinite product 

\[  \prod _{k=1}^{\infty }(1 - x^k) \in R[[x]],  \]

 defined as a multipliable product in the Pi topology on $R[[x]]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pent.pentagonalseries
def.pent.pentagonalSeries

\leanhelper  The \emph{pentagonal series} is the formal power series 

\[  Q = \sum _{n\geq 0} \mathrm{pentagonalCoeff}(n)\,  x^n = \sum _{k\in \mathbb {Z}} (-1)^k x^{w_k} \in R[[x]].  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint defines the pentagonal series generically as \u201cQ = \u2026 \u2208 R[[x]]\u201d, whereas the target quantifies only `\u2200 (n : \u2115)` and fixes the coefficient ring through `PowerSeries.derivative \u2124` (and consequently specializes `pentagonalSeries` and the coefficient equality to `\u2124`). Thus it proves only the integer-coefficient instance, not the statement over the arbitrary ring `R` fixed by the informal definition. This is a restricted quantifier/setting, even though the dependency `pentagonalSeries` itself supports `{R : Type u_1} \u2192 [CommRing R] \u2192 PowerSeries R`. To make it faithful, generalize the target to bind `{R : Type*} [CommRing R]`, use `PowerSeries.derivative R`, instantiate `pentagonalSeries` over `R`, and cast `(-1) ^ k.natAbs` and `n` into `R` on the right-hand side. Apart from this specialization, the match on `pentagonalNumberInverse n` expresses the blueprint\u2019s two cases."
