Docstring: Bundled semiring homomorphisms; use this for bundled ring homomorphisms too.

This extends from both `MonoidHom` and `MonoidWithZeroHom` in order to put the fields in a
sensible order, even though `MonoidWithZeroHom` already extends `MonoidHom`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Semiring
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A `Semiring` is a type with addition, multiplication, a `0` and a `1` where addition is
commutative and associative, multiplication is associative and left and right distributive over
addition, and `0` and `1` are additive and multiplicative identities.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Pow
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The homogeneous version of `HPow`: `a ^ b : α` where `a : α`, `b : β`.
(The right argument is not the same as the left since we often want this even
in the homogeneous case.)

Types can choose to subscribe to particular defaulting behavior by providing
an instance to either `NatPow` or `HomogeneousPow`:
- `NatPow` is for types whose exponents is preferentially a `Nat`.
- `HomogeneousPow` is for types whose base and exponent are preferentially the same.

Body:
fun α [self : Neg α] => self.1

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
The series (1+x)-1

\leanhelper  Define the FPS 

\[  \iota := \sum _{n \in \mathbb {N}} (-1)^n x^n.  \]

 This is the geometric series for $(1+x)^{-1}$; indeed, $\iota \cdot (1+x) = 1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.x
def.fps.x

Let $x$ denote the FPS $\left(0,1,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. In other words, let $x$ denote the FPS with $\left[x^{1}\right]x=1$ and $\left[x^{i}\right]x=0$ for all $i\neq 1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

      "root": "the body of `PowerSeries.invOnePlusX`",
      "severity": "significant",
      "bridge": "The declaration only constructs a power series. Recovering the blueprint requires an additional theorem proving `PowerSeries.invOnePlusX K * (1 + x) = 1`, via the formal-power-series product and coefficient cancellation.

      "root": "[Algebra \u211a K] on `PowerSeries.invOnePlusX`",
      "severity": "significant",
      "bridge": "The blueprint defines the series over its coefficient ring `K` without requiring a \u211a-algebra structure. The formal declaration cannot even be instantiated for commutative rings such as \u2124, although the coefficient sequence `(-1)^n` and the geometric-series identity make sense there. There is no way to recover this unrestricted claim merely by specializing the formal definition; it would require a new definition/generalization without the \u211a-algebra binder."
    }
  ],
  "justification": "The formal signature concludes only `PowerSeries K`, with body `PowerSeries.mk fun n => (algebraMap \u211a K) ((-1) ^ n)`. In contrast, the blueprint not only defines `\u03b9 := \u2211_{n \u2208 \u2115} (-1)^n x^n` but explicitly claims \u201cindeed, `\u03b9 \u00b7 (1+x) = 1`\u201d; no equality appears in the formal declaration. Moreover, the formal signature requires `[Algebra \u211a K]`, while the blueprint's FPS definitions and statement impose no such setting on `K`. The direct coefficient construction is a reasonable re-encoding of the displayed sum where the declaration applies, but it neither proves the inverse identity nor covers all coefficient rings allowed by the blueprint."
