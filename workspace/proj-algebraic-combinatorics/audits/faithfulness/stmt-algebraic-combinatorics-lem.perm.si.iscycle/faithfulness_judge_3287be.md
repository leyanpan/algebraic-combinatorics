## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition_isCycle (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (i : Fin (n - 1)), Equiv.Perm.IsCycle (AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition i)

Docstring: Simple transpositions are cycles (2-cycles). (def.perm.si) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.simpleTransposition (def)
{n : ℕ} → Fin (n - 1) → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn n

Body:
fun {n} i => Equiv.swap ⟨↑i, ⋯⟩ ⟨↑i + 1, ⋯⟩

Docstring: The simple transposition `s_i` swaps `i` and `i+1` in `Fin n`.
Here `i : Fin (n - 1)` ensures `i+1 < n`.
(def.perm.si)

**This is the canonical definition** for simple transpositions in the codebase.

**Equivalent definition in Inversions2.lean:**
`Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition` in `Inversions2.lean` defines the same permutation
using a slightly different construction (with `castSucc`/`succ`). The equivalence is
proven by `Equiv.Perm.simpleTransposition_eq_canonical`.

See the equivalence lemmas `simpleTransposition_eq_swap_*` below for other formulations. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn (def)
ℕ → Type

Body:
fun n => Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Docstring: The n-th symmetric group `S_n` is the group of permutations of `[n]`.
    (def.perm.Sn-iven)

In the textbook, `S_n` is defined as `S_[n]`, the symmetric group of `[n] = {1, 2, ..., n}`.
In Lean, we represent this as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, the group of permutations of
`Fin n = {0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

The size of `S_n` is `n!` (see `sn_card`). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.IsCycle
{α : Type u_2} → Equiv.Perm α → Prop

Docstring: A cycle is a non-identity permutation where any two nonfixed points of the permutation are
related by repeated application of the permutation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.swap
{α : Sort u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → α → α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: `swap a b` is the permutation that swaps `a` and `b` and
leaves other values as is. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.si.isCycle

\leanhelper  Every simple transposition $s_i$ is a cycle (specifically, a $2$-cycle).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.perm.simple
conv.perm.simple

A \emph{simple transposition} in $S_n$ means one of the $n-1$ transpositions $s_0, s_1, \ldots , s_{n-2}$. We shall occasionally abbreviate “simple transposition” as “simple”.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs
def.perm.cycs

Let $X$ be a set. Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k$ be $k$ distinct elements of $X$. Then, 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}  \]

 means the permutation of $X$ that sends 

\begin{align*} & i_1 \text{ to } i_2, \\ & i_2 \text{ to } i_3, \\ & \ldots , \\ & i_{k-1} \text{ to } i_k, \\ & i_k \text{ to } i_1 \end{align*}

 and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged. In other words, $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}$ means the permutation of $X$ that satisfies 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, \ldots , i_k}(p) = \begin{cases}  i_{j+1}, &  \text{if } p = i_j \text{ for some } j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} ;\\ p, &  \text{otherwise} \end{cases}  \]

 for every $p \in X$, where $i_{k+1}$ means $i_1$. 

This permutation is called a $k$\emph{-cycle}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.si
def.perm.si

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $i \in [n-1]$. Then, the \emph{simple transposition} $s_i$ is defined by 

\[  s_i := t_{i, i+1} \in S_n.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij
def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint says, \u201cEvery simple transposition $s_i$ is a cycle (specifically, a $2$-cycle),\u201d with $i\\in[n-1]$. The Lean signature quantifies over exactly the zero-based counterpart, `\u2200 {n : \u2115} (i : Fin (n - 1))`, and `simpleTransposition i` has body `Equiv.swap \u27e8\u2191i, \u2026\u27e9 \u27e8\u2191i + 1, \u2026\u27e9`. Thus it swaps two distinct adjacent elements and fixes all others, so it is specifically a 2-cycle. The shift from textbook `[n] = {1,\u2026,n}` to `Fin n = {0,\u2026,n-1}` merely relabels the same `n-1` adjacent transpositions; the universal claim is unchanged. For `n \u2264 1`, `Fin (n - 1)` is empty, matching the absence of simple transpositions."
