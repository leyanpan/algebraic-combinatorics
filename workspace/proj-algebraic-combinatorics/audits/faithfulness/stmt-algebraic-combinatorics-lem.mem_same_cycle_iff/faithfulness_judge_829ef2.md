## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.CycleDecomposition.mem_same_cycle_iff (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {α : Type u_1} [inst : DecidableEq α] [inst_1 : Fintype α] (σ : Equiv.Perm α) (i j : α),
  i ∈ σ.support →
    ((∃ c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.CycleDecomposition.cycles σ, i ∈ c.support ∧ j ∈ c.support) ↔ σ.SameCycle i j)

Docstring: Two elements are in the same cycle iff they are in the same equivalence class
under the SameCycle relation.

Note: This requires `i ∈ σ.support` (i.e., `i` is not a fixed point) because
`cycleFactorsFinset` only contains non-trivial cycles (length ≥ 2), so fixed points
are not contained in any cycle's support. For fixed points `i = j`, we have
`σ.SameCycle i i` but no cycle containing `i`.

This is an auxiliary characterization connecting cycle membership (in terms of
`cycleFactorsFinset`) to the `SameCycle` relation. The main characterization of
Proposition \ref{prop.perm.cycs.same} is `sameCycle_iff_exists_pow` above. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.CycleDecomposition.cycles (def)
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → Equiv.Perm α → Finset (Equiv.Perm α)

Body:
fun {α} [DecidableEq α] [Fintype α] σ => σ.cycleFactorsFinset

Docstring: The cycles of a permutation σ are the elements of `σ.cycleFactorsFinset`.
Each cycle is a permutation that is a cycle in the graph-theoretic sense.

Note: This only includes cycles of length ≥ 2 (non-trivial cycles).
Fixed points (1-cycles) are not included, following Mathlib's convention.
See `numCyclesTotal` for the total count including 1-cycles.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.support
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → Equiv.Perm α → Finset α

Docstring: The `Finset` of nonfixed points of a permutation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Iff
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: If and only if, or logical bi-implication. `a ↔ b` means that `a` implies `b` and vice versa.
By `propext`, this implies that `a` and `b` are equal and hence any expression involving `a`
is equivalent to the corresponding expression with `b` instead.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `↔` in identifiers is `iff`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<->` in identifiers is `iff` (prefer `↔` over `<->`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.SameCycle
{α : Type u_2} → Equiv.Perm α → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equivalence relation indicating that two points are in the same cycle of a permutation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.cycleFactorsFinset
{α : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → Equiv.Perm α → Finset (Equiv.Perm α)

Docstring: Factors a permutation `f` into a `Finset` of disjoint cyclic permutations that multiply to `f`.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.mem_same_cycle_iff

\leanhelper  Let $X$ be a finite set, $\sigma $ a permutation of $X$, and $i, j \in X$ with $i$ not a fixed point of $\sigma $. Then $i$ and $j$ belong to the support of a common cycle of $\sigma $ if and only if $i$ and $j$ belong to the same cycle of $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.dcdlisttoperm
def.dcdListToPerm

\leanhelper  Given a list of lists (each representing a cycle), the corresponding permutation is obtained by composing the cycle permutations $\operatorname {cyc}_{a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m}$ for each list $(a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m)$ in the input.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs
def.perm.cycs

Let $X$ be a set. Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k$ be $k$ distinct elements of $X$. Then, 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}  \]

 means the permutation of $X$ that sends 

\begin{align*} & i_1 \text{ to } i_2, \\ & i_2 \text{ to } i_3, \\ & \ldots , \\ & i_{k-1} \text{ to } i_k, \\ & i_k \text{ to } i_1 \end{align*}

 and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged. In other words, $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}$ means the permutation of $X$ that satisfies 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, \ldots , i_k}(p) = \begin{cases}  i_{j+1}, &  \text{if } p = i_j \text{ for some } j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} ;\\ p, &  \text{otherwise} \end{cases}  \]

 for every $p \in X$, where $i_{k+1}$ means $i_1$. 

This permutation is called a $k$\emph{-cycle}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs.cycs
def.perm.cycs.cycs

Let $X$ be a finite set. Let $\sigma $ be a permutation of $X$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{cycles} of $\sigma $ are defined to be the cycles in the DCD of $\sigma $ (as defined in Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} \textbf{(a)}). (This includes $1$-cycles, if there are any in the DCD of $\sigma $.) 

We shall equate a cycle of $\sigma $ with any of its cyclic rotations; thus, for example, $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 1,4,3\right) $ shall be regarded as being the same cycle (but $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 3,4,1\right) $ shall not). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{cycle lengths partition} of $\sigma $ shall denote the partition of $\left\vert X\right\vert $ obtained by writing down the lengths of the cycles of $\sigma $ in weakly decreasing order.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binders match the blueprint: `[Fintype \u03b1]` formalizes \u201cLet X be a finite set,\u201d `\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1` is a permutation, `i j : \u03b1` gives `i, j \u2208 X`, and `i \u2208 \u03c3.support` is exactly \u201ci not a fixed point of \u03c3,\u201d since `support` is documented as the finset of nonfixed points. The conclusion `((\u2203 c \u2208 cycles \u03c3, i \u2208 c.support \u2227 j \u2208 c.support) \u2194 \u03c3.SameCycle i j)` directly expresses that i and j lie in the support of a common cycle iff they belong to the same cycle. Although the informal definition of the cycles of \u03c3 includes 1-cycles while `cycles \u03c3 := \u03c3.cycleFactorsFinset` contains only nontrivial cycles, this difference is immaterial under the hypothesis `i \u2208 \u03c3.support`: no 1-cycle can contain the nonfixed point i. `[DecidableEq \u03b1]` is an implementation requirement for finite supports/finsets, not a mathematically contentful restriction on finite sets."
