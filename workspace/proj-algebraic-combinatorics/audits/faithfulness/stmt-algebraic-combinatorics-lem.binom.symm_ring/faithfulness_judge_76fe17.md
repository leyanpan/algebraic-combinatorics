## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.binom_symm_ring (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] [inst_1 : BinomialRing R] [NatPowAssoc R] (n k : ℕ),
  k ≤ n → Ring.choose (↑n) k = Ring.choose (↑n) (n - k)

Docstring: Symmetry of generalized binomial coefficients for `Ring.choose` when the first
argument is a natural number. This extends `binom_symm` to binomial rings. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF BinomialRing
(R : Type u_1) → [AddCommMonoid R] → [Pow R ℕ] → Type u_1

Docstring: A binomial ring is a ring for which ascending Pochhammer evaluations are uniquely divisible by
suitable factorials. We define this notion as a mixin for additive commutative monoids with natural
number powers, but retain the ring name. We introduce `Ring.multichoose` as the uniquely defined
quotient.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ring.choose
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : AddCommGroupWithOne R] → [inst_1 : Pow R ℕ] → [BinomialRing R] → R → ℕ → R

Docstring: The binomial coefficient `choose r n` generalizes the natural number `Nat.choose` function,
interpreted in terms of choosing without replacement.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.binom.symm_ring

\leanhelper  For any binomial ring $R$, natural numbers $n, k$ with $k \leq n$, $\binom {n}{k} = \binom {n}{n-k}$ where $n$ is viewed as an element of $R$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies over \u201cany binomial ring $R$\u201d and imposes only \u201cnatural numbers $n,k$ with $k\\le n$.\u201d The elaborated declaration additionally requires the binder `[NatPowAssoc R]`: `\u2200 {R} [CommRing R] [BinomialRing R] [NatPowAssoc R] ...`. `BinomialRing` is shown only as a mixin depending on `[AddCommMonoid R]` and `[Pow R \u2115]`; the package provides no declaration that every `CommRing`/`BinomialRing` instance supplies `NatPowAssoc`. Thus this is an extra typeclass hypothesis restricting the stated theorem. The declaration would be faithful if `[NatPowAssoc R]` were removed, or if a dependency supplied it for every relevant commutative binomial ring so it were not an additional assumption. The conclusion itself, `Ring.choose (\u2191n) k = Ring.choose (\u2191n) (n-k)` under `k \u2264 n`, matches the stated symmetry with `n` viewed in `R`."
