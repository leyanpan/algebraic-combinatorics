## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.jump_parnum (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (S : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State) (p : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) (q : ℕ) (hp : p ∈ S.levels)
  (hpq : p + ↑q ∉ S.levels) (hq : q > 0), (S.jump p q hp hpq hq).parnum = S.parnum

Docstring: A jump preserves the particle number. 

## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.jump_energy (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (S : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State) (p : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) (q : ℕ) (hp : p ∈ S.levels)
  (hpq : p + ↑q ∉ S.levels) (hq : q > 0), (S.jump p q hp hpq hq).energy = S.energy + 2 * q

Docstring: A jump by q steps raises the energy by 2q.

The proof tracks how the finite sums change when we jump from p to p+q:
- If p ≥ 0: p is removed from the nonneg set, contributing -(2*|p| + 1)
- If p+q ≥ 0: p+q is added to the nonneg set, contributing +(2*|p+q| + 1)
- If p < 0: p is added to the negative_missing set, contributing +(2*|p| - 1)
- If p+q < 0: p+q is removed from the negative_missing set, contributing -(2*|p+q| - 1)

The total change is always 2*q, as proven by `energy_change_formula`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State (inductive)
Type

Body:
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.mk : (levels : Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) →
  {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ levels}.Finite → {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}.Finite → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

Docstring: A "state" is a set of levels that contains all but finitely many negative levels
and only finitely many positive levels.

This is used in Borcherds' proof of Jacobi's triple product identity.

**Important convention**: A "level" in the tex source is a half-integer `p + 1/2` for some integer p.
We represent it by the integer p. Thus:
- "positive level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 > 0`, i.e., `p ≥ 0` in our representation
- "negative level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 < 0`, i.e., `p < 0` in our representation

The structure tracks:
- `finite_nonneg`: the set of nonnegative integers p (representing positive half-integer levels) in S
- `finite_negative_missing`: the set of negative integers p (representing negative half-integer levels) NOT in S 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level (def)
Type

Body:
ℤ

Docstring: A "level" is a half-integer, represented as p + 1/2 for some integer p.
We represent it simply by the integer p. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.levels (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State → Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level

Body:
fun self => self.1

Docstring: The set of levels in this state 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.parnum (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State → ℤ

Body:
fun S => ↑⋯.toFinset.card - ↑⋯.toFinset.card

Docstring: The particle number of a state S is:
  parnum(S) = #{p ≥ 0 : p ∈ S} - #{p < 0 : p ∉ S}

In the tex source, this counts the number of positive half-integer levels in S
minus the number of negative half-integer levels not in S. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.jump (def)
(S : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State) →
  (p : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) → (q : ℕ) → p ∈ S.levels → p + ↑q ∉ S.levels → q > 0 → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

Body:
fun S p q _hp _hpq _hq => { levels := S.levels \ {p} ∪ {p + ↑q}, finite_nonneg := ⋯, finite_negative_missing := ⋯ }

Docstring: Jump operation: if p ∈ S and p + q ∉ S, then jump_{p,q}(S) = (S \ {p}) ∪ {p + q}. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.energy (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State → ℕ

Body:
fun S => ∑ p ∈ ⋯.toFinset, (2 * Int.natAbs p + 1) + ∑ p ∈ ⋯.toFinset, (2 * Int.natAbs p - 1)

Docstring: The energy of a state S is:
  energy(S) = ∑_{p≥0, p∈S} (2p+1) - ∑_{p<0, p∉S} (2p+1)

In the tex source, levels are half-integers `q = p + 1/2`, and the formula is:
  energy(S) = ∑_{q>0, q∈S} 2q - ∑_{q<0, q∉S} 2q

Substituting q = p + 1/2:
- q > 0 ⟺ p ≥ 0
- 2q = 2(p + 1/2) = 2p + 1

For p ≥ 0: 2p + 1 = 2*p.natAbs + 1 (since p.natAbs = p for p ≥ 0)
For p < 0: -(2p + 1) = -2p - 1 = 2*|p| - 1 = 2*p.natAbs - 1 (since p.natAbs = -p for p < 0)

Thus energy is always a natural number. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.finite_nonneg (theorem)
∀ (self : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State), {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ self.levels}.Finite

Docstring: Only finitely many nonnegative levels (p ≥ 0, representing positive half-integers p+1/2 > 0) are in the state 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.finite_negative_missing (theorem)
∀ (self : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State), {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ self.levels}.Finite

Docstring: Only finitely many negative levels (p < 0, representing negative half-integers p+1/2 < 0) are NOT in the state 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.mk (constructor)
(levels : Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) →
  {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ levels}.Finite → {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}.Finite → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`.

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
thm.jtp.jump-parnum-energy

\leanhelper  A jump by $q$ steps keeps the particle number unchanged and raises the energy by $2q$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.jtp.jump
def.jtp.jump

\leanhelper  If $S$ is a state, $p\in S$, and $q$ is a positive integer such that $p+q\notin S$, then the state 

\[  \operatorname {jump}_{p,q}S:=\left( S\setminus \left\{  p\right\}  \right) \cup \left\{  p+q\right\}   \]

 is said to be obtained from $S$ by letting the electron at level $p$ \emph{jump} $q$ steps to the right.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.jtp.state
def.jtp.state

\leanhelper  A \emph{level} is a number of the form $p+\frac{1}{2}$ with $p\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{state} is a set of levels that contains all but finitely many negative levels, and only finitely many positive levels. 

For any state $S$, we define: 

\begin{itemize} \item the \emph{energy} of $S$ to be 

\[  \operatorname {energy}S:=\sum _{\substack {p>0;\\ p\in S}}2p -\sum _{\substack {p<0;\\ p\notin S}}2p \in \mathbb {N};  \]

\item the \emph{particle number} of $S$ to be 

\[  \operatorname {parnum}S:=\left(\text{\#  of positive levels in } S\right) -\left(\text{\#  of negative levels not in } S\right)\in \mathbb {Z}.  \]

\end{itemize}

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "Together the two targets exactly formalize the two conclusions in \u201cA jump by q steps keeps the particle number unchanged and raises the energy by 2q\u201d: `jump_parnum` concludes `(S.jump p q hp hpq hq).parnum = S.parnum`, while `jump_energy` concludes `(S.jump p q hp hpq hq).energy = S.energy + 2 * q`. Their binders `hp : p \u2208 S.levels`, `hpq : p + \u2191q \u2209 S.levels`, and `hq : q > 0` are precisely the conditions in the informal jump definition, and `q : \u2115` with `q > 0` encodes a positive integer. The body of `State.jump`, `S.levels \\ {p} \u222a {p + \u2191q}`, matches the specified set operation. The integer representation of half-integer levels and the bodies of `parnum` and `energy` implement the informal state conventions, including the positive/negative-level boundary. Splitting the informal conjunction into two theorems introduces no drift."
