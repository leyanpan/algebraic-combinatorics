Body:
fun {R} {n m} A U V => A.submatrix ⇑(U.orderEmbOfFin ⋯) ⇑(V.orderEmbOfFin ⋯)

Docstring: The submatrix of A obtained by restricting to rows in U and columns in V.
This corresponds to `sub_U^V A` in the source (Definition def.det.sub).
Label: def.det.sub

## Mathematical Description

Let A be an n×m matrix. Let U ⊆ [n] and V ⊆ [m] be subsets.
Writing U = {u₁, u₂, ..., uₚ} with u₁ < u₂ < ... < uₚ
and V = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₚ} with v₁ < v₂ < ... < vₚ,
we define sub_U^V A := (A_{uᵢ,vⱼ})_{1≤i≤p, 1≤j≤q}.

This is the |U|×|V| matrix obtained from A by keeping only the rows
indexed by U and columns indexed by V, in increasing order.

## Terminology

- **Submatrix**: The matrix sub_U^V A
- **Minor**: When |U| = |V|, the determinant det(sub_U^V A) is called a minor of A
- **Principal minor**: When U = V, the minor det(sub_U^U A) is called a principal minor

## Implementation

In Mathlib, `Matrix.submatrix` takes functions for row and column selection.
For finite sets, we use the canonical order-preserving embedding `orderEmbOfFin`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm

Docstring: An order embedding is an embedding `f : α ↪ β` such that `a ≤ b ↔ (f a) ≤ (f b)`.
This definition is an abbreviation of `RelEmbedding (≤) (≤)`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.orderEmbOfFin
{α : Type u_1} → [inst : LinearOrder α] → (s : Finset α) → {k : ℕ} → s.card = k → Fin k ↪o α

Docstring: Given a finset `s` of cardinality `k` in a linear order `α`, the map `orderEmbOfFin s h` is
the increasing bijection between `Fin k` and `s` as an order embedding into `α`. Here, `h` is a
proof that the cardinality of `s` is `k`. We use this instead of an embedding `Fin s.card ↪o α` to
avoid casting issues in further uses of this function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OrderIso
(α : Type u_6) → (β : Type u_7) → [LE α] → [LE β] → Type (max u_6 u_7)

Docstring: An order isomorphism is an equivalence such that `a ≤ b ↔ (f a) ≤ (f b)`.
This definition is an abbreviation of `RelIso (≤) (≤)`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OrderIso.symm
{α : Type u_2} → {β : Type u_3} → [inst : LE α] → [inst_1 : LE β] → α ≃o β → β ≃o α

Docstring: Inverse of an order isomorphism. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.orderIsoOfFin
{α : Type u_1} → [inst : LinearOrder α] → (s : Finset α) → {k : ℕ} → s.card = k → Fin k ≃o ↥s

Docstring: Given a finset `s` of cardinality `k` in a linear order `α`, the map `orderIsoOfFin s h`
is the increasing bijection between `Fin k` and `s` as an `OrderIso`. Here, `h` is a proof that
the cardinality of `s` is `k`. We use this instead of an iso `Fin s.card ≃o s` to avoid
casting issues in further uses of this function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.mk
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → (val : α) → p val → Subtype p

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.ofBijective

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Surjective

Docstring: A function `f : α → β` is called surjective if every `b : β` is equal to `f a`
for some `a : α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix
Type u → Type u' → Type v → Type (max u u' v)

Docstring: `Matrix m n R` is the type of matrices with entries in `R`, whose rows are indexed by `m`

  {m : Type u_2} → {n : Type u_3} → {o : Type u_4} → {α : Type v} → Matrix m n α → (l → m) → (o → n) → Matrix l o α

Docstring: Given maps `(r : l → m)` and `(c : o → n)` reindexing the rows and columns of
a matrix `M : Matrix m n α`, the matrix `M.submatrix r c : Matrix l o α` is defined
by `(M.submatrix r c) i j = M (r i) (c j)` for `(i,j) : l × o`.
Note that the total number of row and columns does not have to be preserved. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix.det
{n : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq n] → [Fintype n] → {R : Type v} → [CommRing R] → Matrix n n R → R

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available).

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Embedding.mk

## BASE-LIBRARY REF rfl
∀ {α : Sort u} {a : α}, a = a

Docstring: `rfl : a = a` is the unique constructor of the equality type. This is the
same as `Eq.refl` except that it takes `a` implicitly instead of explicitly.

This is a more powerful theorem than it may appear at first, because although
the statement of the theorem is `a = a`, Lean will allow anything that is
definitionally equal to that type. So, for instance, `2 + 2 = 4` is proven in
Lean by `rfl`, because both sides are the same up to definitional equality.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Construction of permutation from components

\leanhelper  Given $P,Q\subseteq [n]$ with $|P|=|Q|$ and permutations $\alpha \in S_k$, $\beta \in S_\ell $ (with $k=|P|$, $\ell =|\overline{P}|$), define $\sigma \in S_n$ by: 

\[  \sigma (p_i) = q_{\alpha (i)} \quad \text{and}\quad \sigma (p'_i) = q'_{\beta (i)}.  \]

 This is the inverse of the map $\sigma \mapsto (\alpha _\sigma ,\beta _\sigma )$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.imagefinset
def.det.imageFinset

\leanhelper  The \emph{image} of a finite subset $P \subseteq [n]$ under a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is $\sigma (P) = \{ \sigma (i) \mid i \in P\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.extract
Extraction of component permutations

\leanhelper  Let $P,Q\subseteq [n]$ with $|P|=|Q|=k$ and let $\sigma \in S_n$ satisfy $\sigma (P) = Q$. Write the elements of $P$ in increasing order as $p_1 < \cdots < p_k$, of $Q$ as $q_1 < \cdots < q_k$, of $\overline{P}$ as $p'_1 < \cdots < p'_\ell $, and of $\overline{Q}$ as $q'_1 < \cdots < q'_\ell $. 

Define $\alpha _\sigma \in S_k$ by $\sigma (p_i) = q_{\alpha _\sigma (i)}$ and $\beta _\sigma \in S_\ell $ by $\sigma (p'_i) = q'_{\beta _\sigma (i)}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.notations
def.perm.notations

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_n$. We introduce three notations for $\sigma $: 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{two-line notation} of $\sigma $ means a $2 \times n$-array 

\[  \begin{pmatrix}  p_1 

&  p_2 

&  \cdots 

&  p_n 

\\ \sigma (p_1) 

&  \sigma (p_2) 

&  \cdots 

&  \sigma (p_n) 

\end{pmatrix},  \]

 where the entries $p_1, p_2, \ldots , p_n$ of the top row are the $n$ elements of $[n]$ in some order. Commonly, we pick $p_i = i$. 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{one-line notation} (short, \emph{OLN}) of $\sigma $ means the $n$-tuple $(\sigma (1), \sigma (2), \ldots , \sigma (n))$. 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{cycle digraph} of $\sigma $ is the directed graph with vertices $1, 2, \ldots , n$ and arcs $i \to \sigma (i)$ for all $i \in [n]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

The informal statement requires, for increasing enumerations, \u201c\u03c3(p_i) = q_{\u03b1(i)}\u201d and \u201c\u03c3(p'_i) = q'_{\u03b2(i)}.\u201d In the body, the branch `if h : x \u2208 P then qEmb (\u03b1 ((P.orderIsoOfFin \u2026).symm \u27e8x, h\u27e9)) else qCEmb (\u03b2 ((P\u1d9c.orderIsoOfFin \u2026).symm \u2026))` first recovers the increasing-order index of `x` in `P` or `P\u1d9c`, applies `\u03b1` or `\u03b2`, and then uses the increasing embedding into `Q` or `Q\u1d9c`. The binders `(P Q : Finset (Fin n)) \u2192 P.card = Q.card \u2192 Equiv.Perm (Fin P.card) \u2192 Equiv.Perm (Fin P\u1d9c.card)` exactly encode `P,Q \u2286 [n]`, `|P|=|Q|`, `\u03b1 \u2208 S_k`, and `\u03b2 \u2208 S_\u2113`, using the stated `Fin n` convention. The resulting function is packaged as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, and `constructSigma_imageFinset` proves `imageFinset (constructSigma \u2026) P = Q`, while `constructSigma_mem_permsMapping` states the equivalent membership condition because `permsMapping P Q` is defined by that equality. Thus the construction is the pointwise inverse to the component extraction described informally; there are no additional mathematically substantive hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
