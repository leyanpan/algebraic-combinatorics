Docstring: The q-binomial coefficient (Gaussian binomial coefficient)
`[n choose k]_q = [n]_q! / ([k]_q! · [n-k]_q!)`.

This is defined as a polynomial in q with integer coefficients.
It counts partitions that fit in a k × (n-k) box, weighted by q^|λ|.

We use the recurrence relation (q-Pascal's identity):
[n choose k]_q = [n-1 choose k-1]_q + q^k · [n-1 choose k]_q

This avoids division and works over any commutative ring.

This definition is equivalent to `AlgebraicCombinatorics.qBinomial` in `QBinomialBasic.lean`,
which uses the monotone function sum definition. The equivalence is proven in
`qBinomial_eq_sum_monotone`. The argument order here is `(q : R) (n k : ℕ)` vs
`(n k : ℕ) (q : R)` in `QBinomialBasic.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.QBinomialRec.kSubsetsOfIcc (def)
ℕ → ℕ → Finset (Finset ℕ)

Body:
fun n k => {S ∈ (Finset.Icc 1 n).powerset | S.card = k}

Docstring: The set of k-element subsets of {1, 2, ..., n}. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.QBinomialRec.finsetSumNat (def)
Finset ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun S => S.sum id

Docstring: The sum of elements in a finite set of natural numbers.

Note: This is named `finsetSumNat` to distinguish from `AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.finsetSumFin`,
which computes the sum of elements in a `Finset (Fin n)` by extracting their `.val`.
Both compute "the sum of elements" but for different element types. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.QBinomialRec.triangular (def)
ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun k => k * (k + 1) / 2

Docstring: The triangular number T(k) = 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.succ

Docstring: The successor of a natural number `n`.

Using `Nat.succ n` should usually be avoided in favor of `n + 1`, which is the [simp normal
form](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/4.28.0/find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=simp-normal-forms).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.powerset
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → Finset (Finset α)

Docstring: When `s` is a finset, `s.powerset` is the finset of all subsets of `s` (seen as finsets). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.Icc
{α : Type u_1} → [inst : Preorder α] → [LocallyFiniteOrder α] → α → α → Finset α

Docstring: The finset $[a, b]$ of elements `x` such that `a ≤ x` and `x ≤ b`. Basically `Set.Icc a b` as a
finset.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instLocallyFiniteOrder
LocallyFiniteOrder ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instAddCommMonoid
AddCommMonoid ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF id
{α : Sort u} → α → α

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.qbinomial-formulas.sum-subsets

\leanhelper  For all $n, k$: 

\[  \binom {n}{k}_q = \sum _{\substack {S \subseteq \{ 1,\ldots ,n\}  \\ |S|=k}} q^{\mathrm{sum}(S) - (1+2+\cdots +k)}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.det.sum-compl
conv.det.sum-compl

For any subset $I$ of $[n]$, we write $\widetilde{I} = [n] \setminus I$ for its complement, and $\operatorname {sum} S = \sum _{s \in S} s$ for any finite set $S$ of integers.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.finsetsumfin
Subset sum and permutation sets

\leanhelper  For a subset $P\subseteq [n]$, define $\operatorname {sum}(P) = \sum _{i\in P} i$. 

For subsets $P,Q\subseteq [n]$, define $\operatorname {Perm}(P,Q) = \{ \sigma \in S_n : \sigma (P)=Q\} $ where $\sigma (P) = \{ \sigma (i) \mid i \in P\} $ denotes the image of $P$ under $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.qbinom.qbinom
def.pars.qbinom.qbinom

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {Z}$. 

\textbf{(a)} The $q$-binomial coefficient (or Gaussian binomial coefficient) $\binom {n}{k}_{q}$ is defined to be the polynomial 

\[  \sum _{\substack {\lambda \text{ is a partition}\\ \text{with largest part }\leq n-k\\ \text{and length }\leq k}}q^{|\lambda |}\in \mathbb {Z}[q].  \]

\textbf{(b)} If $a$ is any element of a ring $A$, then we set 

\[  \binom {n}{k}_{a} := \binom {n}{k}_{q}[a] = \sum _{\substack {\lambda \text{ is a partition}\\ \text{with largest part }\leq n-k\\ \text{and length }\leq k}}a^{|\lambda |}\in A.  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The target narrows two blueprint quantifiers. Its signature has `\u2200 {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] ... (n k : \u2115)`, whereas the informal definition fixes `n \u2208 \u2115` but `k \u2208 \u2124`, and says evaluation is allowed when `a` is \u201cany element of a ring A.\u201d Thus the Lean theorem covers only natural `k` and commutative rings, omitting negative integer `k` and noncommutative rings. These are mathematically contentful restrictions, not merely encoding instances. The discrepancy enters through `qBinomial`, whose type is `[CommRing R] \u2192 R \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 R`, and through `kSubsetsOfIcc`, whose cardinality parameter is also `\u2115`. A faithful formulation would extend `qBinomial` and the subset-sum expression to an integer index `k : \u2124`\u2014with the appropriate empty/zero behavior outside the natural range\u2014and weaken the algebraic binder to the blueprint\u2019s general ring setting. The natural-number subtraction in the exponent is not itself problematic on contributing subsets, since a `k`-subset of `{1,\u2026,n}` has sum at least `1+\u22ef+k`."
