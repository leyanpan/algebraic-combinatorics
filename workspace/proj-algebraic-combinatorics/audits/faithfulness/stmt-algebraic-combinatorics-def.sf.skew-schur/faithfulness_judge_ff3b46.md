## TARGET skewSchurPoly (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → MvPolynomial (Fin N) ℤ

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => ∑ f ∈ ssytFillings lam mu, fillingMonomial f

Docstring: The skew Schur polynomial s_{λ/μ} is the sum of monomials x_T over all
semistandard skew tableaux of shape λ/μ.
Definition \ref{def.sf.skew-schur} in the source.

We define this as a sum over the finite set of valid SSYT fillings:
s_{λ/μ} = ∑_{T ∈ SSYT(λ/μ)} x_T

The definition proceeds by:
1. Representing tableaux as functions from the skew diagram to Fin N
2. Filtering for those satisfying the SSYT conditions (row-weak, column-strict)
3. Summing the associated monomials

## Relationship to Other Definitions

This project has two skew Schur polynomial definitions with different design tradeoffs:

| Definition | File | Input | Ring | Use case |
|------------|------|-------|------|----------|
| `skewSchurPoly` (this) | SchurBasics.lean | `NPartition N` | `ℤ` | Proofs using skew diagrams, symmetry |
| `AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewSchurPoly` | LittlewoodRichardson.lean | `Fin N → ℕ` | generic `R` | Littlewood-Richardson rule, generic rings |

**When to use which:**
- Use **this definition** when working with skew Young diagrams, SSYT fillings, or proving
  symmetry properties. It requires `[NeZero N]` and uses integer coefficients.
- Use **`AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewSchurPoly`** when you need a generic coefficient ring
  or when working with the Littlewood-Richardson rule. It takes unbundled `Fin N → ℕ`.

**Equivalence:** See `SSYTEquiv.lean` for the bridge between these definitions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SkewFilling (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Type

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => { c // c ∈ skewYoungDiagram lam mu } → Fin N

Docstring: The type of all fillings of a skew diagram with entries in Fin N.
This is finite since the diagram is finite and Fin N is finite. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY ssytFillings (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → (lam mu : NPartition N) → Finset (SkewFilling lam mu)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => Finset.filter (isSSYTFilling lam mu) Finset.univ

Docstring: The finite set of all valid SSYT fillings. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY fillingMonomial (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → {lam mu : NPartition N} → SkewFilling lam mu → MvPolynomial (Fin N) ℤ

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] {lam mu} f => ∏ c, MvPolynomial.X (f c)

Docstring: The monomial associated to a filling.
x_f = ∏_{c ∈ Y(λ/μ)} x_{f(c)} 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => lam.youngDiagram \ mu.youngDiagram

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is the set difference Y(λ) \ Y(μ).
Definition \ref{def.sf.skew-diag} in the source.

**Note**: This is a duplicate of `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` that requires `[NeZero N]`.
Prefer `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` for new code as it works for all `N`.

For N-partitions λ and μ with μ ⊆ λ, the skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is defined as:
```
Y(λ) \ Y(μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ [λ_i] \ [μ_i]}
            = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ ℤ and μ_i < j ≤ λ_i}
```
(The second form uses 1-indexed j as in the textbook.)

In our 0-indexed formalization, this becomes:
```
Y(λ/μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ Fin N and μ_i ≤ j < λ_i}
```

Example: Y((4,3,1)/(2,1,0)) consists of cells:
- Row 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)  (since μ₀ = 2, λ₀ = 4)
- Row 1: (1, 1), (1, 2)  (since μ₁ = 1, λ₁ = 3)
- Row 2: (2, 0)          (since μ₂ = 0, λ₂ = 1) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY isSSYTFilling (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → (lam mu : NPartition N) → SkewFilling lam mu → Prop

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu f =>
  (∀ (c1 c2 : { c // c ∈ skewYoungDiagram lam mu }), (↑c1).1 = (↑c2).1 → (↑c1).2 < (↑c2).2 → f c1 ≤ f c2) ∧
    ∀ (c1 c2 : { c // c ∈ skewYoungDiagram lam mu }), (↑c1).2 = (↑c2).2 → (↑c1).1 < (↑c2).1 → f c1 < f c2

Docstring: The set of fillings that correspond to valid semistandard tableaux.
We check the conditions on pairs of cells in the diagram:
- Row-weak: if c1 and c2 are in the same row with c1 to the left, then f(c1) ≤ f(c2)
- Column-strict: if c1 and c2 are in the same column with c1 above, then f(c1) < f(c2) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY isSSYTFilling_decidable (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → (lam mu : NPartition N) → (f : SkewFilling lam mu) → Decidable (isSSYTFilling lam mu f)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu f => id inferInstance

Docstring: The SSYT condition is decidable since we're quantifying over finite types. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY skewFilling_fintype (def)
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → (lam mu : NPartition N) → Fintype (SkewFilling lam mu)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => Fintype.ofFinite (SkewFilling lam mu)

Docstring: Fillings are finite. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.youngDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} μ => Finset.univ.biUnion fun i => Finset.map { toFun := fun j => (i, j), inj' := ⋯ } (Finset.range (μ.parts i))

Docstring: The Young diagram Y(λ) of an N-partition λ is the set of cells (i, j) where
i ∈ Fin N and j < λ_i.
Definition def.sf.ydiag in the source.

Note: Mathlib has `YoungDiagram` which is more general (infinite diagrams).
Here we define a version specific to N-partitions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF NeZero
{R : Type u_1} → [Zero R] → R → Prop

Docstring: A type-class version of `n ≠ 0`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

CommSemiring ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is antitone if `a ≤ b` implies `f b ≤ f a`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PartialOrder.toPreorder

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instPreorder
Preorder ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommMonoid
{α : Type u} → [self : CommRing α] → CommMonoid α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.Subtype.fintype

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.X
{R : Type u} → {σ : Type u_1} → [inst : CommSemiring R] → σ → MvPolynomial σ R

Docstring: `X n` is the degree `1` monomial $X_n$. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SDiff.sdiff
{α : Type u} → [self : SDiff α] → α → α → α

Docstring: `a \ b` is the set difference of `a` and `b`,
consisting of all elements in `a` that are not in `b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `\` in identifiers is `sdiff`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSDiff
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → SDiff (Finset α)

Docstring: `s \ t` is the set consisting of the elements of `s` that are not in `t`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqProd
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq α] → [DecidableEq β] → DecidableEq (α × β)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLEFin
{n : ℕ} → LE (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable
Prop → Type

Docstring: Either a proof that `p` is true or a proof that `p` is false. This is equivalent to a `Bool` paired
with a proof that the `Bool` is `true` if and only if `p` is true.

`Decidable` instances are primarily used via `if`-expressions and the tactic `decide`. In
conditional expressions, the `Decidable` instance for the proposition is used to select a branch. At
run time, this case distinction code is identical to that which would be generated for a
`Bool`-based conditional. In proofs, the tactic `decide` synthesizes an instance of `Decidable p`,
attempts to reduce it to `isTrue h`, and then succeeds with the proof `h` if it can.

Because `Decidable` carries data, when writing `@[simp]` lemmas which include a `Decidable` instance
on the LHS, it is best to use `{_ : Decidable p}` rather than `[Decidable p]` so that non-canonical
instances can be found via unification rather than instance synthesis.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF id
{α : Sort u} → α → α

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstance
{α : Sort u} → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstance` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This function has the same type signature as the identity
function, but the square brackets on the `[i : α]` argument means that it will
attempt to construct this argument by typeclass inference. (This will fail if
`α` is not a `class`.) Example:
```
#check (inferInstance : Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat

def foo : Inhabited (Nat × Nat) :=
  inferInstance

example : foo.default = (default, default) :=
  rfl
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 5 < 12 by decide`

{n : ℕ} → (a b : Fin n) → Decidable (a ≤ b)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.decLt
{n : ℕ} → (a b : Fin n) → Decidable (a < b)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.ofFinite
(α : Type u_4) → [Finite α] → Fintype α

Docstring: Noncomputably get a `Fintype` instance from a `Finite` instance. This is not an
instance because we want `Fintype` instances to be useful for computations. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.biUnion
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq β] → Finset α → (α → Finset β) → Finset β

Docstring: `Finset.biUnion s t` is the union of `t a` over `a ∈ s`.

(This was formerly `bind` due to the monad structure on types with `DecidableEq`.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α ↪ β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Embedding.mk
{α : Sort u_1} → {β : Sort u_2} → (toFun : α → β) → Function.Injective toFun → α ↪ β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range
ℕ → Finset ℕ

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.skew-schur

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. We define the \emph{skew Schur polynomial} $s_{\lambda /\mu }\in \mathcal{P}$ by

\[  s_{\lambda /\mu }:=\sum _{T\in \operatorname *{SSYT}\left( \lambda /\mu \right) }x_{T}.  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint says only, \u201cLet \u03bb and \u03bc be two N-partitions,\u201d and imposes no condition that N \u2260 0. The elaborated target instead has the additional binder `{N : \u2115} \u2192 [NeZero N] \u2192 ...`, so it does not define the skew Schur polynomial for 0-partitions. This is a mathematically contentful restriction, not merely a decidability or notation instance: `NeZero N` literally asserts `N \u2260 0`. The restriction propagates through `SkewFilling`, `ssytFillings`, `fillingMonomial`, `skewYoungDiagram`, and `isSSYTFilling`, each of which also has `[NeZero N]`, even though `NPartition` and `NPartition.youngDiagram` are defined for every `N`. Apart from this restriction, the body `\u2211 f \u2208 ssytFillings lam mu, fillingMonomial f` matches the stated sum over SSYT monomials. To make the declaration faithful, remove `[NeZero N]` from the target and those dependencies, using the all-`N` Young-diagram construction; alternatively, the blueprint would need to state that `N > 0`."
