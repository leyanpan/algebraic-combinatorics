## TARGET Nat.Partition.filter_largestPart_le_eq_restricted (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n m : ℕ), {p | p.largestPart ≤ m} = Nat.Partition.restricted n fun x => x ≤ m

Docstring: The set of partitions with largest part ≤ m equals the set of partitions
with all parts ≤ m (i.e., `restricted n (· ≤ m)`).

This is a key equivalence used in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm.pars.main-gf-0n}. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.largestPart (def)
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → ℕ

Body:
fun {n} p => Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts

Docstring: The largest part of a partition (0 for the empty partition).
(Convention \ref{conv.pars.largest-part-0}) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.instFintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype n.Partition

Docstring: Show there are finitely many partitions by considering the surjection from compositions to
partitions.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.restricted
(n : ℕ) → (p : ℕ → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset n.Partition

Docstring: The finset of those partitions in which every part satisfies a certain condition. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.fold
{α : Type u_1} → (op : α → α → α) → [hc : Std.Commutative op] → [ha : Std.Associative op] → α → Multiset α → α

Docstring: `fold op b s` folds a commutative associative operation `op` over
the multiset `s`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Max.max
{α : Type u} → [self : Max α] → α → α → α

Docstring: Returns the greater of its two arguments. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `max` in identifiers is `max`.

 * The recommended spelling of `⊔` in identifiers is `sup` (`⊔` is the preferred notation for `max` when the type is not linearly ordered.).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMax
Max ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instCommutativeMax
Std.Commutative max

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instAssociativeMax
Std.Associative max

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.parts
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → Multiset ℕ

Docstring: positive integers summing to `n` 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.pars.filter-largestPart-le-eq-restricted

\leanhelper  The set of partitions of $n$ whose largest part is $\le m$ equals the set of partitions of $n$ with all parts $\le m$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.pars.largest-part-0
conv.pars.largest-part-0

We agree to say that the largest part of the empty partition $\left( {}\right) $ is $0$ (even though this partition has no parts).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unclear",
  "justification": "The formal declaration explicitly quantifies `\u2200 (n m : \u2115)`, while the informal statement merely says \u201cpartitions of $n$ whose largest part is $\\le m$\u201d and does not state the domains of `n` and `m`. This matters because `def.pars.parts` defines \u201ca partition of $n$\u201d for `n \\in \\mathbb Z`, whereas the target only covers natural-number indices; moreover, allowing a negative `m` would make the claimed equivalence fail for the empty partition, whose largest part is defined as `0` although \u201call parts \u2264 m\u201d is vacuous. If the missing ambient convention is `n,m \\in \\mathbb N`, the target is faithful: `largestPart` is `Multiset.fold max 0 p.parts`, matching the empty-partition convention, and `Nat.Partition.restricted n (fun x => x \u2264 m)` means every part is at most `m`. The package needs the blueprint\u2019s ambient binder/domain convention for `n` and `m` to decide whether the natural-number binders are faithful or a restriction."
