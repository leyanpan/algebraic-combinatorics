## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.sortTupleFinsupp (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N →₀ ℕ) → AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N

Body:
fun {N} d => AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.sortTuple (Finsupp.equivFunOnFinite d)

Docstring: sortTupleFinsupp applied to a Finsupp. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.NPartition (def)
ℕ → Type

Body:
fun N => NPartition N

Docstring: Alias for the canonical `NPartition` type within this namespace.
An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

All basic operations (`size`, `length`, `zero`, etc.) and lemmas are inherited
from the canonical `_root_.NPartition` definition in `NPartition.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.sortTuple (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.NPartition N

Body:
fun {N} a =>
  {
    parts := fun i =>
      have sorted := (Multiset.map a Finset.univ.val).sort fun x1 x2 => x1 ≥ x2;
      if h : ↑i < sorted.length then sorted.get ⟨↑i, h⟩ else 0,
    antitone := ⋯ }

Docstring: Sort a tuple in weakly decreasing order to get an N-partition.
(Definition def.sf.sort (b)) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.mk (constructor)
{N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finsupp
Type u_9 → (M : Type u_10) → [Zero M] → Type (max u_10 u_9)

Docstring: `Finsupp α M`, denoted `α →₀ M`, is the type of functions `f : α → M` such that
`f x = 0` for all but finitely many `x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv
Sort u_1 → Sort u_2 → Sort (max (max 1 u_1) u_2)

Docstring: `α ≃ β` is the type of functions from `α → β` with a two-sided inverse. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finsupp.equivFunOnFinite
{α : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_4} → [inst : Zero M] → [Finite α] → (α →₀ M) ≃ (α → M)

Docstring: Given `Finite α`, `equivFunOnFinite` is the `Equiv` between `α →₀ β` and `α → β`.
(All functions on a finite type are finitely supported.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.sort
{α : Type u_1} →
  Multiset α →
    (r : autoParam (α → α → Prop) Multiset.sort._auto_1) →
      [DecidableRel r] → [IsTrans α r] → [Std.Antisymm r] → [Std.Total r] → List α

Docstring: `sort s` constructs a sorted list from the multiset `s`.
(Uses merge sort algorithm.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type v} → (α → β) → Multiset α → Multiset β

Docstring: `map f s` is the lift of the list `map` operation. The multiplicity
of `b` in `map f s` is the number of `a ∈ s` (counting multiplicity)
such that `f a = b`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.val
{α : Type u_4} → Finset α → Multiset α

Docstring: The underlying multiset 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 5 < 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is antitone if `a ≤ b` implies `f b ≤ f a`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PartialOrder.toPreorder
{α : Type u_2} → [self : PartialOrder α] → Preorder α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.instPartialOrder
{n : ℕ} → PartialOrder (Fin n)

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.sortTupleFinsupp

\leanhelper  The finitely-supported version of $\operatorname {sort}$: for a finitely-supported function $d$ from $[N]$ to $\mathbb {N}$, $\operatorname {sortFinsupp}(d) = \operatorname {sort}(d)$, where $d$ is viewed as a function $[N] \to \mathbb {N}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.sort.b
def.sf.sort.b

\leanhelper  For $a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N) \in \mathbb {N}^N$, $\operatorname {sort} a$ is the $N$-partition obtained by sorting the entries of $a$ in weakly decreasing order.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target has exactly the required input and output: ` {N : \u2115} \u2192 (Fin N \u2192\u2080 \u2115) \u2192 ... NPartition N`. Its body, `fun {N} d => sortTuple (Finsupp.equivFunOnFinite d)`, matches \u201c`sortFinsupp(d) = sort(d)`, where `d` is viewed as a function `[N] \u2192 \u2115`\u201d: `Finsupp.equivFunOnFinite` performs precisely that viewing on the finite type `Fin N`, and `sortTuple` sorts the resulting tuple weakly decreasingly into an `NPartition`. There are no additional mathematical hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
