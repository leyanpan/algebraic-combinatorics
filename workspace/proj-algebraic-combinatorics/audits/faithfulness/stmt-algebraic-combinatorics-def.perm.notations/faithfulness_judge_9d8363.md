{n : ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn n → List (Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ => List.map (⇑σ) (List.finRange n)

Docstring: The one-line notation of a permutation σ ∈ S_n, as a list [σ(0), σ(1), ..., σ(n-1)].

Note: We use 0-indexing (Fin n starts at 0), so this is [σ(0), σ(1), ..., σ(n-1)]
rather than [σ(1), σ(2), ..., σ(n)] as in the textbook.

Body:
fun {n} σ => { Adj := fun i j => i ≠ j ∧ (σ i = j ∨ σ j = i), symm := ⋯, loopless := ⋯ }

Docstring: The cycle digraph of a permutation σ, as an undirected simple graph.

There is an edge between i and j iff σ(i) = j or σ(j) = i (and i ≠ j).
This captures the "orbit structure" of the permutation.

{n : ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn n → List (Fin n × Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ => List.map (fun i => (i, σ i)) (List.finRange n)

Docstring: The two-line notation of a permutation σ ∈ S_n, represented as a list of pairs
[(1, σ(1)), (2, σ(2)), ..., (n, σ(n))].

This corresponds to the standard two-line notation:
  ⎛ 1      2      ...  n    ⎞
  ⎝ σ(1)  σ(2)  ...  σ(n)  ⎠

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Sn (def)
ℕ → Type

Body:
fun n => Equiv.Perm (Fin n)

Docstring: The n-th symmetric group `S_n` is the group of permutations of `[n]`.
    (def.perm.Sn-iven)

In the textbook, `S_n` is defined as `S_[n]`, the symmetric group of `[n] = {1, 2, ..., n}`.
In Lean, we represent this as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, the group of permutations of
`Fin n = {0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

The size of `S_n` is `n!` (see `sn_card`). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α → β) → List α → List β

Docstring: Applies a function to each element of the list, returning the resulting list of values.

`O(|l|)`.

Examples:
* `[a, b, c].map f = [f a, f b, f c]`
* `[].map Nat.succ = []`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.length) = [3, 3, 5]`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.reverse) = ["eno", "owt", "eerht"]`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.finRange
(n : ℕ) → List (Fin n)

Docstring: Lists all elements of `Fin n` in order, starting at `0`.

Examples:
* `List.finRange 0 = ([] : List (Fin 0))`
* `List.finRange 2 = ([0, 1] : List (Fin 2))`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF SimpleGraph
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A simple graph is an irreflexive symmetric relation `Adj` on a vertex type `V`.
The relation describes which pairs of vertices are adjacent.
There is exactly one edge for every pair of adjacent vertices;
see `SimpleGraph.edgeSet` for the corresponding edge set.

  (Adj : V → V → Prop) →
    autoParam (Symmetric Adj) SimpleGraph.symm._autoParam →
      autoParam (Std.Irrefl Adj) SimpleGraph.loopless._autoParam → SimpleGraph V

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Or
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Or a b`, or `a ∨ b`, is the disjunction of propositions. There are two
constructors for `Or`, called `Or.inl : a → a ∨ b` and `Or.inr : b → a ∨ b`,
and you can use `match` or `cases` to destruct an `Or` assumption into the
two cases.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∨` in identifiers is `or`.

 * The recommended spelling of `\/` in identifiers is `or` (prefer `∨` over `\/`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.perm.notations

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_n$. We introduce three notations for $\sigma $: 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{two-line notation} of $\sigma $ means a $2 \times n$-array 

\[  \begin{pmatrix}  p_1 

&  p_2 

&  \cdots 

&  p_n 

\\ \sigma (p_1) 

&  \sigma (p_2) 

&  \cdots 

&  \sigma (p_n) 

\end{pmatrix},  \]

 where the entries $p_1, p_2, \ldots , p_n$ of the top row are the $n$ elements of $[n]$ in some order. Commonly, we pick $p_i = i$. 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{one-line notation} (short, \emph{OLN}) of $\sigma $ means the $n$-tuple $(\sigma (1), \sigma (2), \ldots , \sigma (n))$. 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{cycle digraph} of $\sigma $ is the directed graph with vertices $1, 2, \ldots , n$ and arcs $i \to \sigma (i)$ for all $i \in [n]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "Clause (c) is not faithfully represented. The blueprint says \u201cthe directed graph \u2026 with arcs i \u2192 \u03c3(i),\u201d whereas `cycleDigraph` has codomain `SimpleGraph (Fin n)`, whose adjacency is necessarily symmetric and irreflexive, and its body is `i \u2260 j \u2227 (\u03c3 i = j \u2228 \u03c3 j = i)`. Thus it forgets arc orientation, adds reverse adjacency, and deletes the loops arising from fixed points. This enters through the target declaration\u2019s `SimpleGraph (Fin n)` codomain and adjacency body. It should instead use a directed-graph structure, or a raw relation with arcs `fun i j => \u03c3 i = j`, without `i \u2260 j` or the reverse disjunct. Clause (a) is also narrowed: the blueprint permits any ordering `p\u2081,\u2026,p\u2099` of `[n]`, while `twoLineNotation` fixes `List.finRange n` and returns only `[(i, \u03c3 i)]`; this is the commonly chosen special case, not the full notion of a two-line notation. To capture the full definition it should accept an ordering/enumeration of `Fin n` and map it to `(p, \u03c3 p)`. By contrast, `oneLineNotation` faithfully realizes clause (b) as `List.map \u03c3 (List.finRange n)` under the project\u2019s explicit zero-indexed representation `Sn n = Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`."
