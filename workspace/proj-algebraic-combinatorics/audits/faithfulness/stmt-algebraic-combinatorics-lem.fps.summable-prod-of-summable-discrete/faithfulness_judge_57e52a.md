## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.summable-prod-of-summable-discrete

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Product of two summable families.)} Assume $K$ has the discrete topology. If $(f_\alpha )_{\alpha \in A}$ and $(g_\beta )_{\beta \in B}$ are summable families in $K[[x]]$, then the family $(f_\alpha \cdot g_\beta )_{(\alpha ,\beta )\in A\times B}$ is summable.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

    {
      "root": "[inst : CommRing K]",
      "severity": "significant",
      "bridge": "The formal theorem applies only when the coefficient type carries a commutative-ring structure. The blueprint imposes only that \u201cK has the discrete topology\u201d; its supplied FPS definitions use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and zero but do not require the commutative-ring axioms. Recovering the blueprint at that stated generality would require proving a generalized theorem for every coefficient structure on which those definitions make sense; it does not follow by specialization or a routine instance construction from the CommRing theorem."
    }
  ],
  "justification": "The elaborated signature quantifies `\u2200 {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] [inst_1 : TopologicalSpace K] [DiscreteTopology K]`, whereas the informal statement says only \u201cAssume K has the discrete topology.\u201d Under the supplied `PowerSeries` body and pointwise topology, Lean's unconditional `Summable` matches the informal coefficientwise-essentially-finite notion in the discrete case, and the Lean multiplication is the stated Cauchy product up to the standard `Finsupp Unit \u2115 \u2243 \u2115` encoding. The unsupported extra algebraic restriction is therefore the decisive divergence."
