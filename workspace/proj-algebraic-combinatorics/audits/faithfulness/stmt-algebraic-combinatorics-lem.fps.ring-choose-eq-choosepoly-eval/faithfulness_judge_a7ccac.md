## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.Ring_choose_eq_choosePoly_eval (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] [inst_1 : Algebra ℚ K] [inst_2 : BinomialRing K] [CharZero K] (k : ℕ) (c : K),
  Ring.choose c k = Polynomial.eval c (Polynomial.map (algebraMap ℚ K) (AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.choosePoly✝ k))

Docstring: Ring.choose c k equals the evaluation of choosePoly.map at c.
This is the key lemma showing Ring.choose is a polynomial function. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY _private.AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.NonIntegerPowers.0.AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.choosePoly (def)
ℕ → Polynomial ℚ

Body:
fun k => (↑k.factorial)⁻¹ • descPochhammer ℚ k

Docstring: The polynomial for Ring.choose: Q_k(X) = (1/k!) * descPochhammer(X, k) over ℚ.
This polynomial, when mapped to K and evaluated at c, gives Ring.choose c k.

Docstring: A binomial ring is a ring for which ascending Pochhammer evaluations are uniquely divisible by
suitable factorials. We define this notion as a mixin for additive commutative monoids with natural
number powers, but retain the ring name. We introduce `Ring.multichoose` as the uniquely defined
quotient.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CharZero
(R : Type u_1) → [AddMonoidWithOne R] → Prop

Docstring: Typeclass for monoids with characteristic zero.
  (This is usually stated on fields but it makes sense for any additive monoid with 1.)

*Warning*: for a semiring `R`, `CharZero R` and `CharP R 0` need not coincide.
* `CharZero R` requires an injection `ℕ ↪ R`;
* `CharP R 0` asks that only `0 : ℕ` maps to `0 : R` under the map `ℕ → R`.
  For instance, endowing `{0, 1}` with addition given by `max` (i.e. `1` is absorbing), shows that
  `CharZero {0, 1}` does not hold and yet `CharP {0, 1} 0` does.
  This example is formalized in `Counterexamples/CharPZeroNeCharZero.lean`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF algebraMap

Docstring: Embedding `R →+* A` given by `Algebra` structure. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Polynomial
(R : Type u_1) → [Semiring R] → Type u_1

Docstring: `Polynomial R` is the type of univariate polynomials over `R`,
denoted as `R[X]` within the `Polynomial` namespace.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

with coefficients in the ring `R`.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.Ring-choose-eq-choosePoly-eval

\leanhelper  The generalized binomial coefficient $\binom {c}{k}$ equals the evaluation of a polynomial in~ $c$: there exists a polynomial $p_k\in \mathbb {Q}[x]$ such that $\binom {c}{k} = p_k(c)$ for all $c\in K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The formal equality is stronger than the existential conclusion in one respect: `choosePoly\u271d k : Polynomial \u211a` supplies an explicit witness, and because `(c : K)` is universally quantified, the same polynomial works for all `c`. However, the target restricts the ambient algebra by the binders `[CommRing K] [Algebra \u211a K] [BinomialRing K] [CharZero K]`, whereas the informal definition says that `n` may be \u201cany element in a \u211a-algebra,\u201d and the statement quantifies over all `c \u2208 K`. In particular, commutativity, a separate `BinomialRing K` structure, and `CharZero K` are not stipulated by the blueprint. The package provides no result showing these are automatic for every intended \u211a-algebra, so they cannot be treated as mere encoding. The difference enters through the TARGET\u2019s typeclass binders. To make it faithful, generalize the target to the blueprint\u2019s \u211a-algebra setting and express the binomial coefficient by the stated falling-factorial-over-`k!` formula, or provide canonical consequences/instances showing that every intended \u211a-algebra satisfies the additional binders."
