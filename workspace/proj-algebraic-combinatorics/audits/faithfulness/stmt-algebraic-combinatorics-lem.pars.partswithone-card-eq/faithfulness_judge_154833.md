## TARGET Nat.Partition.partsWithOne_card_eq (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {k n : ℕ}, k > 0 → n > 0 → (Nat.Partition.partsWithOne k n).card = Nat.Partition.partsCount (k - 1) (n - 1)

Docstring: Bijection: partsWithOne k n ↔ partitions of (n-1) into (k-1) parts. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.partsWithOne (def)
ℕ → (n : ℕ) → Finset n.Partition

Body:
fun k n => {p | p.parts.card = k ∧ p.containsOne}

Docstring: Partitions of n into k parts that contain 1. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.partsCount (def)
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun k n => {p | p.parts.card = k}.card

Docstring: The function `p_k(n)`: the number of partitions of `n` into exactly `k` parts.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pn-pkn} (a)) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.containsOne (def)
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → Prop

fun {n} p => 1 ∈ p.parts

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

is a type of finite sets with duplicates allowed. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Multiset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidablePred

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.pars.partsWithOne-card-eq

\leanhelper  For $k>0$ and $n>0$: 

\[  |\{ \text{partitions of $n$ into $k$ parts containing 1}\} | = p_{k-1}(n-1).  \]

 The bijection removes/adds a trailing~ $1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.pn-pkn
def.pars.pn-pkn

\textbf{(a)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. Then, we set

\[  p_{k}\left( n\right) :=\left( \text{\#  of partitions of }n\text{ into }k\text{ parts}\right) .  \]

\textbf{(b)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, we set

\[  p\left( n\right) :=\left( \text{\#  of partitions of }n\right) .  \]

 This is called the $n$\emph{-th partition number}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.removeone-addone
def.pars.removeOne-addOne

\leanhelper  Given a partition of $n$ that contains $1$ as a part, removing one copy of~ $1$ yields a partition of $n-1$. Conversely, adding one copy of~ $1$ to a partition of $n$ yields a partition of $n+1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The binders `\u2200 {k n : \u2115}, k > 0 \u2192 n > 0 \u2192` exactly match \u201cFor $k>0$ and $n>0$.\u201d By definition, `Nat.Partition.partsWithOne k n = {p | p.parts.card = k \u2227 p.containsOne}`, and `containsOne` means `1 \u2208 p.parts`, so its cardinality is precisely the number of partitions of `n` into `k` parts containing 1. Also, `Nat.Partition.partsCount (k - 1) (n - 1)` is the number of partitions of `n-1` into exactly `k-1` parts, matching `$p_{k-1}(n-1)$`. Since positivity prevents any semantic issue from truncated natural subtraction, the formal equality states exactly the blueprint claim."
