## TARGET NPartition.add_size (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {N : ℕ} (μ ν : NPartition N), (μ + ν).size = μ.size + ν.size

Docstring: The size of a sum of N-partitions equals the sum of their sizes. 

## TARGET NPartition.add (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → NPartition N → NPartition N

Body:
fun {N} μ ν => { parts := fun i => μ.parts i + ν.parts i, antitone := ⋯ }

Docstring: Component-wise addition of N-partitions.
Since both partitions are antitone (weakly decreasing), their sum is also antitone. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.size (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} μ => ∑ i, μ.parts i

Docstring: The size (or weight) of an N-partition is the sum of its entries.
If μ = (μ₁, μ₂, ..., μ_N), then |μ| = μ₁ + μ₂ + ... + μ_N. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.instAdd (def)
{N : ℕ} → Add (NPartition N)

Body:
fun {N} => { add := NPartition.add }

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.mk (constructor)
{N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is antitone if `a ≤ b` implies `f b ≤ f a`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

the assumption `Fintype α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.Npar-add

\leanhelper  The componentwise sum of two $N$-partitions is an $N$-partition, and $|\mu + \nu | = |\mu | + |\nu |$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.tuple-addition
def.sf.tuple-addition

\textbf{(a)} We let $\mathbf{0}$ denote the $N$-tuple $\left( 0,0,\ldots ,0\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$. 

\medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{N}\right) $ and $\beta =\left( \beta _{1},\beta _{2},\ldots ,\beta _{N}\right) $ be two $N$-tuples in $\mathbb {N}^{N}$. Then, we set

\begin{align*}  \alpha +\beta &  :=\left( \alpha _{1}+\beta _{1},\alpha _{2}+\beta _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{N}+\beta _{N}\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\\ \alpha -\beta &  :=\left( \alpha _{1}-\beta _{1},\alpha _{2}-\beta _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{N}-\beta _{N}\right) . \end{align*}

 Note that $\alpha +\beta \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$, whereas $\alpha -\beta \in \mathbb {Z}^{N}$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formalization captures both clauses. The blueprint says, \u201cThe componentwise sum of two $N$-partitions is an $N$-partition,\u201d and `NPartition.add` has signature `{N : \u2115} \u2192 NPartition N \u2192 NPartition N \u2192 NPartition N` with entries `parts := fun i => \u03bc.parts i + \u03bd.parts i`; its result type and `antitone` field establish that this componentwise sum is again an `NPartition N`. The second clause, \u201c$|\\mu + \\nu| = |\\mu| + |\\nu|$,\u201d is exactly the target `\u2200 {N : \u2115} (\u03bc \u03bd : NPartition N), (\u03bc + \u03bd).size = \u03bc.size + \u03bd.size`. Moreover, `NPartition.size` is `\u2211 i, \u03bc.parts i`, matching the informal definition of size. There are no additional hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
