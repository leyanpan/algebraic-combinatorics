Docstring: **Key counting lemma for prop.perm.lisitij**: When σ(i) > σ(j), the number of
lost inversions exceeds gained inversions by exactly 2|Q| + 1.

The proof proceeds by partitioning pairs (a, b) with a < b into categories:
1. The pair (i, j) itself: loses 1 inversion
2. Pairs (i, k) and (k, j) for k ∈ Q: each loses 1 inversion (total 2|Q|)
3. Pairs (a, i) and (a, j) for a < i: swap status, so net 0
4. Pairs (i, b) and (j, b) for b > j: swap status, so net 0
5. Pairs (i, k) and (k, j) for i < k < j, k ∉ Q: unchanged or swap, net 0
6. Other pairs: unchanged

Total: lost - gained = 2|Q| + 1

Body:
fun {n} σ => {p | p.1 < p.2 ∧ σ p.2 < σ p.1}

Docstring: The set of inversions of a permutation. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.setQ (def)
{n : ℕ} → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Fin n → Fin n → Finset (Fin n)

Body:
fun {n} σ i j => {k | i < k ∧ k < j ∧ σ j < σ k ∧ σ k < σ i}

Docstring: The set Q from Proposition prop.perm.lisitij:
Q = {k ∈ {i+1, ..., j-1} | σ(i) > σ(k) > σ(j)}
This counts elements between i and j whose images are strictly between σ(j) and σ(i). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SDiff.sdiff
{α : Type u} → [self : SDiff α] → α → α → α

Docstring: `a \ b` is the set difference of `a` and `b`,
consisting of all elements in `a` that are not in `b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `\` in identifiers is `sdiff`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.lost-minus-gained

\leanhelper  Let $\sigma \in S_n$ and $i < j$ with $\sigma (j) < \sigma (i)$. Then the number of “lost” inversions (inversions of $\sigma $ that are not inversions of $\sigma \cdot t_{i,j}$) exceeds the number of “gained” inversions (inversions of $\sigma \cdot t_{i,j}$ that are not inversions of $\sigma $) by exactly $2|Q| + 1$. 

The proof partitions lost inversions into five disjoint types: the pair $(i,j)$ itself; pairs $(a,j)$ and $(i,b)$ for $a \in A$, $b \in B$; and pairs $(i,k)$ and $(k,j)$ for $k \in Q$. Gained inversions are pairs $(a,i)$ for $a \in A$ and $(j,b)$ for $b \in B$. The sets $A$ and $B$ cancel, leaving $2|Q|+1$.

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.seta
def.perm.setA

\leanhelper  The set $A$ from the transposition length proof: $A = \{ a < i \mid \sigma (j) < \sigma (a) < \sigma (i)\} $. These elements produce paired lost and gained inversions: $(a, j)$ is lost and $(a, i)$ is gained.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.setb
def.perm.setB

\leanhelper  The set $B$ from the transposition length proof: $B = \{ b > j \mid \sigma (j) < \sigma (b) < \sigma (i)\} $. These elements produce paired lost and gained inversions: $(i, b)$ is lost and $(j, b)$ is gained.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.setq
def.perm.setQ

\leanhelper  The set $Q$ from Proposition~ \ref{prop.perm.lisitij}: $Q = \{ k \in \{ i+1, \ldots , j-1\}  \mid \sigma (j) < \sigma (k) < \sigma (i)\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij
def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal binders exactly match the blueprint hypotheses: `\u2200 {n : \u2115} (\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (i j : Fin n), i < j \u2192 \u03c3 j < \u03c3 i \u2192 ...`, using the explicitly prescribed `Fin n` convention for `\u03c3 \u2208 S_n`. The conclusion `(\u03c3.inversions \\ (\u03c3 * Equiv.swap i j).inversions).card = ((\u03c3 * Equiv.swap i j).inversions \\ \u03c3.inversions).card + 2 * (\u03c3.setQ i j).card + 1` says precisely that lost inversions equal gained inversions plus `2|Q|+1`, hence that lost exceeds gained by that amount. `Equiv.Perm.inversions` has body `{p | p.1 < p.2 \u2227 \u03c3 p.2 < \u03c3 p.1}`, matching the informal inversion definition, while `Equiv.Perm.setQ` has body `{k | i < k \u2227 k < j \u2227 \u03c3 j < \u03c3 k \u2227 \u03c3 k < \u03c3 i}`, matching the blueprint\u2019s Q. Finally, `\u03c3 * Equiv.swap i j` agrees with the supplied convention that multiplication is composition sending `x` to `\u03c3 (swap i j x)`, i.e. `\u03c3 \u00b7 t_{i,j}`."
