## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.flipSign_involutive (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {d : ℕ} (k : Fin d), Function.Involutive (AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.flipSign k)

Docstring: flipSign is an involution 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.flipSign (def)
{d : ℕ} → Fin d → (Fin d → ZMod 2) → Fin d → ZMod 2

Body:
fun {d} k e => Function.update e k (e k + 1)

Docstring: The involution that flips the k-th sign: if `e_k = +1`, make it `-1`, and vice versa 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Involutive
{α : Sort u_1} → (α → α) → Prop

Docstring: A function is involutive, if `f ∘ f = id`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ZMod
ℕ → Type

Docstring: The integers modulo `n : ℕ`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.update
{α : Sort u} → {β : α → Sort v} → [DecidableEq α] → ((a : α) → β a) → (a' : α) → β a' → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: Replacing the value of a function at a given point by a given value.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.cancel.flipSign-involutive

\leanhelper  For any $k \in [d]$, the map $\operatorname {flipSign}_k$ is an involution.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.cancel.flipsign
def.cancel.flipSign

\leanhelper  For $k \in [d]$, the map $\operatorname {flipSign}_k : \{ 1,-1\} ^d \to \{ 1,-1\} ^d$ sends a $d$-tuple $(e_1, \ldots , e_d)$ to the tuple obtained by flipping the sign of the $k$-th entry: i.e., replacing $e_k$ by $-e_k$ and leaving all other entries unchanged.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invol
def.perm.invol

Let $X$ be a set. An \emph{involution} of $X$ means a map $f : X \to X$ that satisfies $f \circ f = \operatorname {id}$. Clearly, an involution is always a permutation, and equals its own inverse.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies `\u2200 {d : \u2115} (k : Fin d)` exactly as the blueprint\u2019s \u201cFor any $k \\in [d]$,\u201d using the stated convention that `Fin d` represents `[d]`. Its conclusion `Function.Involutive (flipSign k)` has precisely the stipulated meaning $f \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}$. The dependency defines `flipSign k e` as `Function.update e k (e k + 1)`: on `ZMod 2`, adding one exchanges the two values and leaves every other coordinate unchanged, so under the two-element encoding of signs it is exactly the operation exchanging $+1$ and $-1$. Thus applying it twice restores the original tuple. The formal use of `(Fin d \u2192 ZMod 2)` rather than literal sign tuples is a representation of the same two-valued coordinate set, not a mathematically contentful restriction."
