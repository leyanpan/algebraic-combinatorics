## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.partition_recursive (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ n > 0,
  ↑(AlgebraicCombinatorics.partitionCount n) =
    ∑' (k : { k // k ≠ 0 ∧ AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber k ≤ n }),

Docstring: **Corollary \ref{cor.pars.pn-rec}**: Recursive formula for partition numbers.

For each positive integer n:
  p(n) = ∑_{k∈ℤ, k≠0} (-1)^{k-1} p(n - w_k)
       = p(n-1) + p(n-2) - p(n-5) - p(n-7) + p(n-12) + p(n-15) - ...

where p(m) = 0 for m < 0.

Note: The sign (-1)^{k-1} is computed using `(k.natAbs + 1) % 2` to handle
negative k correctly. For k ≠ 0, (-1)^{k-1} equals (-1)^{|k|-1} = (-1)^{|k|+1}.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.partitionCount (def)
ℕ → ℕ

Body:
Nat.Partition.partitionCount

Docstring: Local alias for `Nat.Partition.partitionCount` from `Partitions/Basics.lean`.
This provides compatibility with existing code in this file. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.pentagonalNumber (def)
ℤ → ℕ

Body:
fun k => ((3 * k - 1) * k / 2).toNat

Docstring: The k-th pentagonal number, defined as w_k = (3k - 1) * k / 2.
This is always a nonnegative integer for any k ∈ ℤ.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pent-num}) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Nat.Partition.partitionCount (def)
ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun n => Fintype.card n.Partition

Docstring: The partition function `p(n)`: the number of partitions of `n`.
(Definition \ref{def.pars.pn-pkn} (b)) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF tsum
{α : Type u_4} →
  {β : Type u_5} →
    [AddCommMonoid α] →
      [TopologicalSpace α] → (β → α) → optParam (SummationFilter β) (SummationFilter.unconditional β) → α

Docstring: `∑' i, f i` is the unconditional sum of `f` if it exists, or 0 otherwise.

More generally, if `L` is a `SummationFilter`, `∑'[L] i, f i` is the sum of `f` with respect to
`L` if it exists, and `0` otherwise.

(Note that even if the unconditional sum exists, it might not be unique if the topology is not
separated. When the support of `f` is finite, we make the most reasonable choice, to use the sum
over the support. Otherwise, we choose arbitrarily an `a` satisfying `HasSum f a`. Similar remarks
apply to more general summation filters.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instMul

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMod.hMod
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMod α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a % b` computes the remainder upon dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For `Nat` and `Int` it satisfies `a % b + b * (a / b) = a`,
  and `a % 0` is defined to be `a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `%` in identifiers is `mod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHMod
{α : Type u_1} → [Mod α] → HMod α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMod
Mod ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.natAbs
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: The absolute value of an integer is its distance from `0`.

This function is overridden by the compiler with an efficient implementation. This definition is
the logical model.

Examples:
 * `(7 : Int).natAbs = 7`
 * `(0 : Int).natAbs = 0`
 * `(-11 : Int).natAbs = 11`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Neg.neg
{α : Type u} → [self : Neg α] → α → α

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `neg` (when used as a unary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instNegInt
Neg ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat
Sub ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SummationFilter.unconditional
(β : Type u_2) → SummationFilter β

Docstring: **Unconditional summation**: a function on `β` is said to be *unconditionally summable* if its
partial sums over finite subsets converge with respect to the `atTop` filter. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.toNat
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: Converts an integer into a natural number. Negative numbers are converted to `0`.

Examples:
* `(7 : Int).toNat = 7`
* `(0 : Int).toNat = 0`
* `(-7 : Int).toNat = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HDiv.hDiv
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HDiv α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a / b` computes the result of dividing `a` by `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For most types like `Nat`, `Int`, `Rat`, `Real`, `a / 0` is defined to be `0`.
* For `Nat`, `a / b` rounds downwards.
* For `Int`, `a / b` rounds downwards if `b` is positive or upwards if `b` is negative.
  It is implemented as `Int.ediv`, the unique function satisfying
  `a % b + b * (a / b) = a` and `0 ≤ a % b < natAbs b` for `b ≠ 0`.
  Other rounding conventions are available using the functions
  `Int.fdiv` (floor rounding) and `Int.tdiv` (truncation rounding).
* For `Float`, `a / 0` follows the IEEE 754 semantics for division,
  usually resulting in `inf` or `nan`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `/` in identifiers is `div`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHDiv
{α : Type u_1} → [Div α] → HDiv α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDiv
Div ℤ

Docstring: The `Div Int` and `Mod Int` instances use `Int.ediv` and `Int.emod` for compatibility with SMT-LIB and
because mathematical reasoning tends to be easier.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.card
(α : Type u_4) → [Fintype α] → ℕ

Docstring: `card α` is the number of elements in `α`, defined when `α` is a fintype.

For each positive integer $n$, we have 

\begin{align*}  p\left( n\right) &  =\sum _{\substack {k\in \mathbb {Z};\\ \begin{bgroup} k\neq 0

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies \u201cFor each positive integer n,\u201d and the target has exactly `\u2200 n > 0` with `n : \u2115`; positive integers are represented without loss by positive naturals. Its left side `\u2191(partitionCount n)` is the integer-valued count of partitions of `n`, since `partitionCount n = Fintype.card n.Partition`. On the right, the target sums over `k : { k // k \u2260 0 \u2227 pentagonalNumber k \u2264 n }`. This is a faithful finite-support encoding of the blueprint\u2019s sum over all `k \u2208 \u2124, k \u2260 0`: terms with `w_k > n` have `n-w_k < 0`, and the blueprint\u2019s `p(n-w_k)` is zero because there are no partitions of a negative integer. For retained terms, natural subtraction gives the same nonnegative argument. The project definition `pentagonalNumber k = ((3 * k - 1) * k / 2).toNat` agrees with `w_k = ((3k-1)k)/2`, whose value is always a nonnegative integer. Finally, `if (\u2191k).natAbs % 2 = 1 then 1 else -1` has sign `+1` for odd `|k|` and `-1` for even `|k|`, exactly `(-1)^{k-1}`. The displayed sequence `p(n-1)+p(n-2)-p(n-5)-p(n-7)+\u22ef` is the expansion of these terms for `k=1,-1,2,-2,\u2026`, not an additional restriction omitted by the target."
