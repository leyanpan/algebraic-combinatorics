∀ {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] {n : ℕ} (x : R) (P : Finset (Fin n)),
  2 ≤ P.card →
    ((AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.constMatrix x).submatrix ⇑(P.orderEmbOfFin ⋯) ⇑(P.orderEmbOfFin ⋯)).det = 0

Docstring: For a submatrix of a constant matrix, if the submatrix has size ≥ 2, its determinant is 0.
This is because all rows are identical. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.CauchyBinet.constMatrix (def)
{R : Type u_1} → {n : ℕ} → R → Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) R

Body:
fun {R} {n} x x_1 x_2 => x

Docstring: The constant x matrix (all entries equal to x). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

  {m : Type u_2} → {n : Type u_3} → {o : Type u_4} → {α : Type v} → Matrix m n α → (l → m) → (o → n) → Matrix l o α

Docstring: Given maps `(r : l → m)` and `(c : o → n)` reindexing the rows and columns of
a matrix `M : Matrix m n α`, the matrix `M.submatrix r c : Matrix l o α` is defined
by `(M.submatrix r c) i j = M (r i) (c j)` for `(i,j) : l × o`.
Note that the total number of row and columns does not have to be preserved.

{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OrderEmbedding
(α : Type u_6) → (β : Type u_7) → [LE α] → [LE β] → Type (max u_6 u_7)

Docstring: An order embedding is an embedding `f : α ↪ β` such that `a ≤ b ↔ (f a) ≤ (f b)`.
This definition is an abbreviation of `RelEmbedding (≤) (≤)`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.orderEmbOfFin
{α : Type u_1} → [inst : LinearOrder α] → (s : Finset α) → {k : ℕ} → s.card = k → Fin k ↪o α

Docstring: Given a finset `s` of cardinality `k` in a linear order `α`, the map `orderEmbOfFin s h` is
the increasing bijection between `Fin k` and `s` as an order embedding into `α`. Here, `h` is a
proof that the cardinality of `s` is `k`. We use this instead of an embedding `Fin s.card ↪o α` to
avoid casting issues in further uses of this function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF rfl
∀ {α : Sort u} {a : α}, a = a

Docstring: `rfl : a = a` is the unique constructor of the equality type. This is the
same as `Eq.refl` except that it takes `a` implicitly instead of explicitly.

This is a more powerful theorem than it may appear at first, because although
the statement of the theorem is `a = a`, Lean will allow anything that is
definitionally equal to that type. So, for instance, `2 + 2 = 4` is proven in
Lean by `rfl`, because both sides are the same up to definitional equality.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.det.const.matrix.zero

\leanhelper  Let $A$ be the $n\times n$ constant matrix with all entries equal to $x$. If $P\subseteq [n]$ has $|P| \ge 2$, then $\det (\operatorname {sub}_P^P A) = 0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.det.matrices
conv.det.matrices

Let $n, m \in \mathbb {N}$. 

\textbf{(a)} If $A$ is an $n \times m$-matrix, then $A_{i,j}$ shall mean the $(i,j)$-th entry of $A$, that is, the entry of $A$ in row $i$ and column $j$. 

\textbf{(b)} If $a_{i,j}$ is an element of $K$ for each $i \in [n]$ and each $j \in [m]$, then 

\[  \left( a_{i,j} \right)_{1 \leq i \leq n,\;  1 \leq j \leq m}  \]

 shall denote the $n \times m$-matrix whose $(i,j)$-th entry is $a_{i,j}$ for all $i \in [n]$ and $j \in [m]$. 

\textbf{(c)} We let $K^{n \times m}$ denote the set of all $n \times m$-matrices with entries in $K$. This is a $K$-module. If $n = m$, this is also a $K$-algebra. 

\textbf{(d)} Let $A \in K^{n \times m}$ be an $n \times m$-matrix. The \emph{transpose} $A^T$ of $A$ is defined to be the $m \times n$-matrix whose entries are given by 

\[  \left( A^T \right)_{i,j} = A_{j,i} \quad \text{for all } i \in [m] \text{ and } j \in [n].  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.kalg
def.alg.Kalg

A $K$\emph{-algebra} is a set $A$ equipped with four maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \ominus &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \odot &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times A\rightarrow A \end{align*}

 and two elements $\overrightarrow {0}\in A$ and $\overrightarrow {1}\in A$ satisfying the following properties: 

\begin{enumerate} \item The set $A$, equipped with the maps $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ and the two elements $\overrightarrow {0}$ and $\overrightarrow {1}$, is a (noncommutative) ring. 

\item The set $A$, equipped with the maps $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ and the element $\overrightarrow {0}$, is a $K$-module. 

\item We have

\begin{equation}  \lambda \rightharpoonup \left( a\odot b\right) =\left( \lambda \rightharpoonup a\right) \odot b=a\odot \left( \lambda \rightharpoonup b\right) \end{equation}

 for all $\lambda \in K$ and $a,b\in A$. 

\end{enumerate}

(Thus, in a nutshell, a $K$-algebra is a set $A$ that is simultaneously a ring and a $K$-module, with the property that the ring $A$ and the $K$-module $A$ have the same addition, the same subtraction and the same zero, and satisfy the additional compatibility property (\ref{eq.def.alg.Kalg.scaleinv}).)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.module
def.alg.module

Let $K$ be a commutative ring. 

A $K$\emph{-module} means a set $M$ equipped with three maps 

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \ominus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times M\rightarrow M \end{align*}

 (notice that the third map has domain $K\times M$, not $M\times M$) and an element $\overrightarrow {0}\in M$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in M$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of scaling:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) =\left( uv\right) \rightharpoonup a$ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left distributivity:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( a\oplus b\right) =\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( u\rightharpoonup b\right) $ for all $u\in K$ and $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right distributivity:} We have $\left( u+v\right) \rightharpoonup a=\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) $ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $1\rightharpoonup a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left annihilation:} We have $0\rightharpoonup a=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right annihilation:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $u\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{scaling} (or the $K$\emph{-action}) of the $K$-module $M$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\rightharpoonup b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The element $\overrightarrow {0}$ is called the \emph{zero} (or the \emph{zero vector}) of the $K$-module $M$. We will usually just call it $0$. 

When $M$ is a $K$-module, the elements of $M$ are called \emph{vectors}, while the elements of $K$ are called \emph{scalars}. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $, with the operation $\rightharpoonup $ having higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.ring
def.alg.ring

The notion of a \emph{ring} (also known as a \emph{noncommutative ring}) is defined in the exact same way as we defined the notion of a commutative ring in Definition~ \ref{def.alg.commring}, except that the “Commutativity of multiplication” axiom is removed.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.det
def.det.det

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. Let $A \in K^{n \times n}$ be an $n \times n$-matrix. The \emph{determinant} $\det A$ of $A$ is defined to be the element 

\[  \sum _{\sigma \in S_n} (-1)^{\sigma } \underbrace{A_{1,\sigma (1)} A_{2,\sigma (2)} \cdots A_{n,\sigma (n)}}_{ = \prod _{i=1}^{n} A_{i,\sigma (i)}}  \]

 of $K$. Here: 

\begin{itemize} \item we let $S_n$ denote the $n$-th symmetric group (i.e., the group of permutations of $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $); 

\item we let $(-1)^{\sigma }$ denote the sign of the permutation $\sigma $ (as defined in Definition~ \ref{def.perm.sign}). 

\end{itemize}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.sub
def.det.sub

Let $n,m\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $A$ be an $n\times m$-matrix. 

Let $U$ be a subset of $[n]$. Let $V$ be a subset of $[m]$. 

Writing the two sets $U$ and $V$ as 

\[  U=\{ u_1,u_2,\ldots ,u_p\}  \quad \text{and}\quad V=\{ v_1,v_2,\ldots ,v_q\}   \]

 with 

\[  u_1<u_2<\cdots <u_p \quad \text{and}\quad v_1<v_2<\cdots <v_q,  \]

 we set 

\[  \operatorname {sub}_U^V A:=\left(A_{u_i,v_j}\right)_{1\le i\le p,\  1\le j\le q}.  \]

Roughly speaking, $\operatorname {sub}_U^V A$ is the matrix obtained from $A$ by focusing only on the $i$-th rows for $i\in U$ (that is, removing all the other rows) and only on the $j$-th columns for $j\in V$ (that is, removing all the other columns). 

This matrix $\operatorname {sub}_U^V A$ is called the \emph{submatrix of} $A$ \emph{obtained by restricting to the $U$-rows and the $V$-columns}. If this matrix is square (i.e., if $|U|=|V|$), then its determinant $\det (\operatorname {sub}_U^V A)$ is called a \emph{minor} of $A$.

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. The \emph{sign} of a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is defined to be the integer $(-1)^{\ell (\sigma )}$. 

It is denoted by $(-1)^{\sigma }$ or $\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )$ or $\operatorname {sign}(\sigma )$ or $\varepsilon (\sigma )$. It is also known as the \emph{signature} of $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal binders `\u2200 {R : Type u_1} [CommRing R] {n : \u2115} (x : R) (P : Finset (Fin n)), 2 \u2264 P.card \u2192 ...` match a constant `n \u00d7 n` matrix over a commutative ring and a subset `P \u2286 [n]` with `|P| \u2265 2`. The dependency `constMatrix` has body `fun ... x_1 x_2 => x`, so every matrix entry is exactly `x`, as required by \u201cthe constant matrix with all entries equal to x.\u201d The two occurrences of `P.orderEmbOfFin` enumerate the selected indices increasingly, and `Matrix.submatrix` therefore realizes `sub_P^P A` according to the informal definition. Its determinant is asserted equal to `0`, exactly matching `det (sub_P^P A) = 0`. Using `Fin n` (indices `0,\u2026,n\u22121`) instead of the book\u2019s one-based `[n]` is only an index representation and does not alter this statement."
