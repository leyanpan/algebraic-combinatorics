## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.partitionToState_bijective (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (ell : ℤ), Function.Bijective fun p => ⟨AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedState ell p.snd, ⋯⟩

Docstring: Every state with particle number ℓ can be written as E_{ℓ,μ} for a unique partition μ.

This establishes a bijection Φ_ℓ : {partitions} → {states with particle number ℓ}.
The map sends a partition μ to the excited state E_{ℓ,μ}.

Note: We express this as bijectivity onto the subtype {S : State // S.parnum = ell}
rather than as a map to State × ℤ (which would not be surjective since the particle
number of excitedState is always ell). 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State (inductive)
Type

Body:
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.mk : (levels : Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) →
  {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ levels}.Finite → {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}.Finite → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

Docstring: A "state" is a set of levels that contains all but finitely many negative levels
and only finitely many positive levels.

This is used in Borcherds' proof of Jacobi's triple product identity.

**Important convention**: A "level" in the tex source is a half-integer `p + 1/2` for some integer p.
We represent it by the integer p. Thus:
- "positive level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 > 0`, i.e., `p ≥ 0` in our representation
- "negative level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 < 0`, i.e., `p < 0` in our representation

The structure tracks:
- `finite_nonneg`: the set of nonnegative integers p (representing positive half-integer levels) in S
- `finite_negative_missing`: the set of negative integers p (representing negative half-integer levels) NOT in S 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.parnum (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State → ℤ

Body:
fun S => ↑⋯.toFinset.card - ↑⋯.toFinset.card

Docstring: The particle number of a state S is:
  parnum(S) = #{p ≥ 0 : p ∈ S} - #{p < 0 : p ∉ S}

In the tex source, this counts the number of positive half-integer levels in S
minus the number of negative half-integer levels not in S. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedState (def)
ℤ → {n : ℕ} → n.Partition → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

Body:
fun ell {n} mu =>
  { levels := AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedStateLevels ell mu, finite_nonneg := ⋯, finite_negative_missing := ⋯ }

Docstring: The excited state E_{ℓ,μ} obtained from the ground state by jumping electrons
according to the partition μ.

Given a partition μ = (μ₁, μ₂, ..., μₖ) of some n, we start with the ℓ-ground state
and let the k highest electrons jump by μ₁, μ₂, ..., μₖ steps respectively. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedState_parnum (theorem)
∀ (ell : ℤ) {n : ℕ} (mu : n.Partition), (AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedState ell mu).parnum = ell

Docstring: The particle number of an excited state equals ℓ. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level (def)
Type

Body:
ℤ

Docstring: A "level" is a half-integer, represented as p + 1/2 for some integer p.
We represent it simply by the integer p. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.levels (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.State → Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level

Body:
fun self => self.1

Docstring: The set of levels in this state 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.finite_nonneg (theorem)
∀ (self : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State), {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ self.levels}.Finite

Docstring: Only finitely many nonnegative levels (p ≥ 0, representing positive half-integers p+1/2 > 0) are in the state 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.finite_negative_missing (theorem)
∀ (self : AlgebraicCombinatorics.State), {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ self.levels}.Finite

Docstring: Only finitely many negative levels (p < 0, representing negative half-integers p+1/2 < 0) are NOT in the state 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.mk (constructor)
(levels : Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level) →
  {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ levels}.Finite → {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}.Finite → AlgebraicCombinatorics.State

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedStateLevels (def)
ℤ → {n : ℕ} → n.Partition → Set AlgebraicCombinatorics.Level

Body:
fun ell {n} mu =>
  let parts := mu.parts.sort fun x1 x2 => x1 ≥ x2;
  let k := parts.length;
  {p | p < ell - ↑k} ∪ {p | ∃ i, p = ell - 1 - ↑↑i + ↑(parts.get (Fin.cast ⋯ i))}

Docstring: The explicit set of levels in an excited state E_{ℓ,μ}.
E_{ℓ,μ} = {p | p < ℓ-k} ∪ {ℓ-1-i+μ_i | i ∈ {0,...,k-1}}
where k is the number of parts and μ_i are the parts (sorted in decreasing order).

We use `mu.parts.sort (· ≥ ·)` to get a canonical decreasing ordering of parts.
This ensures that the excited levels uniquely encode the partition, since with sorted
parts the function `i ↦ parts[i] - i` is strictly decreasing (hence injective). 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedStateLevels_finite_nonneg (theorem)
∀ (ell : ℤ) {n : ℕ} (mu : n.Partition), {p | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedStateLevels ell mu}.Finite

Docstring: The excited state has finitely many nonnegative levels. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedStateLevels_finite_negative_missing (theorem)
∀ (ell : ℤ) {n : ℕ} (mu : n.Partition), {p | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedStateLevels ell mu}.Finite

Docstring: The excited state has finitely many missing negative levels. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Bijective
{α : Sort u₁} → {β : Sort u₂} → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function is called bijective if it is both injective and surjective. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sigma
{α : Type u} → (α → Type v) → Type (max u v)

Docstring: Dependent pairs, in which the second element's type depends on the value of the first element. The
type `Sigma β` is typically written `Σ a : α, β a` or `(a : α) × β a`.

Although its values are pairs, `Sigma` is sometimes known as the *dependent sum type*, since it is
the type level version of an indexed summation.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.mk
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → (val : α) → p val → Subtype p

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sigma.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : α → Type v} → Sigma β → α

Docstring: The first component of a dependent pair.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Sigma.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : α → Type v} → (self : Sigma β) → β self.fst

Docstring: The second component of a dependent pair. Its type depends on the first component.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instLEInt
LE ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instLTInt
LT ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instNatCastInt
NatCast ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite.toFinset
{α : Type u} → {s : Set α} → s.Finite → Finset α

Docstring: Using choice, get the `Finset` that represents this `Set`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.

{α : Type u_1} →
  Multiset α →
    (r : autoParam (α → α → Prop) Multiset.sort._auto_1) →
      [DecidableRel r] → [IsTrans α r] → [Std.Antisymm r] → [Std.Total r] → List α

Docstring: `sort s` constructs a sorted list from the multiset `s`.
(Uses merge sort algorithm.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.parts
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → Multiset ℕ

Docstring: positive integers summing to `n` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Union.union
{α : Type u} → [self : Union α] → α → α → α

Docstring: `a ∪ b` is the union of `a` and `b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∪` in identifiers is `union`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instUnion
{α : Type u} → Union (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.cast
{n m : ℕ} → n = m → Fin n → Fin m

Docstring: Uses a proof that two bounds are equal to allow a value bounded by one to be used with the other.

In other words, when `eq : n = m`, `Fin.cast eq i` converts `i : Fin n` into a `Fin m`.

\[  E_{\ell ,\lambda }=\left\{  \text{all levels }<\ell -k\right\}  \cup \left\{  \ell -i+\tfrac {1}{2}+\lambda _{i}\  \mid \  i\in \{ 1,\ldots ,k\} \right\} .  \]

\[  \operatorname {jump}_{p,q}S:=\left( S\setminus \left\{  p\right\}  \right) \cup \left\{  p+q\right\}   \]

\leanhelper  A \emph{level} is a number of the form $p+\frac{1}{2}$ with $p\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{state} is a set of levels that contains all but finitely many negative levels, and only finitely many positive levels. 

For any state $S$, we define: 

\begin{itemize} \item the \emph{energy} of $S$ to be

def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint states: \u201cFor each \u2113 \u2208 \u2124, the map \u03a6\u2113 : {partitions} \u2192 {states with particle number \u2113}, \u03bb \u21a6 E\u2113,\u03bb is a bijection.\u201d The target has exactly the outer quantifier `\u2200 (ell : \u2124)` and asserts `Function.Bijective fun p => \u27e8AlgebraicCombinatorics.State.excitedState ell p.snd, \u22ef\u27e9`. Here the dependent pair of an index and `n.Partition` represents an arbitrary partition, while the constructed subtype element represents a state satisfying `S.parnum = ell`; this is justified by `excitedState_parnum`. The formal `excitedStateLevels` body also agrees with the informal half-integer convention: its integer representatives `{p | p < ell - k}` and `ell - 1 - i + \u03bc\u1d62` correspond respectively to levels below `\u2113-k` and to `\u2113-(i+1)+1/2+\u03bc\u1d62`. The definitions of `State` and `parnum` likewise translate positive half-integer levels to representatives `p \u2265 0` and negative ones to `p < 0`. There are no added hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
