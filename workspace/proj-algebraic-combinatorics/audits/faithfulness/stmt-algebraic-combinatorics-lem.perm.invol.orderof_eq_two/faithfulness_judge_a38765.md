## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution.orderOf_eq_two_of_ne_one (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {X : Type u_1} [Fintype X] {σ : Equiv.Perm X}, AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution σ → σ ≠ 1 → orderOf σ = 2

Docstring: A nontrivial involution has order exactly 2. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsInvolution (def)
{X : Type u_1} → Equiv.Perm X → Prop

Body:
fun {X} σ => σ * σ = 1

Docstring: A permutation is an involution if `σ ∘ σ = id`. (def.perm.invol)

From the textbook:
> An *involution* of X means a map f: X → X that satisfies f ∘ f = id.
> Clearly, an involution is always a permutation, and equals its own inverse.

Equivalent characterizations:
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ σ * σ = 1` (definition)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ σ⁻¹ = σ` (see `isInvolution_iff_eq_inv`)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ Function.Involutive σ` (see `isInvolution_iff_involutive`)
- `IsInvolution σ ↔ ∀ x, σ (σ x) = x` (see `isInvolution_iff_forall`)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF One.toOfNat1
{α : Type u_1} → [One α] → OfNat α 1

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm.instOne
{α : Type u_4} → One (Equiv.Perm α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF orderOf
{G : Type u_1} → [Monoid G] → G → ℕ

Docstring: `orderOf x` is the order of the element `x`, i.e. the `n ≥ 1`, s.t. `x ^ n = 1` if it exists.
Otherwise, i.e. if `x` is of infinite order, then `orderOf x` is `0` by convention. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DivInvMonoid.toMonoid
{G : Type u} → [self : DivInvMonoid G] → Monoid G

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Group.toDivInvMonoid
{G : Type u} → [self : Group G] → DivInvMonoid G

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.invol.orderOf_eq_two

\leanhelper  A nontrivial involution (i.e., $\sigma \ne \operatorname {id}$) has order exactly $2$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invol
def.perm.invol

Let $X$ be a set. An \emph{involution} of $X$ means a map $f : X \to X$ that satisfies $f \circ f = \operatorname {id}$. Clearly, an involution is always a permutation, and equals its own inverse.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The target adds the binder `[Fintype X]` in `\u2200 {X : Type u_1} [Fintype X] {\u03c3 : Equiv.Perm X}, ...`, restricting the theorem to finite sets. The blueprint says only \u201cA nontrivial involution ... has order exactly 2,\u201d while its definition begins \u201cLet X be a set\u201d and imposes no finiteness assumption. This is a mathematically contentful narrowed quantifier, not merely encoding: `Equiv.Perm X`, `IsInvolution \u03c3`, and `orderOf \u03c3` are all available without `Fintype X`. The remaining clauses match: `IsInvolution \u03c3` means `\u03c3 * \u03c3 = 1`, `\u03c3 \u2260 1` means nonidentity, and `orderOf \u03c3 = 2` is exactly order two. Removing `[Fintype X]` from the target signature would make it faithful."
