## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq_mono (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {N : ℕ} {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} (T : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu) (j : ℕ) (i : Fin N),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq T (j + 1) i ≤ AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq T j i

Docstring: contentColGeq is monotonic: cells in columns >= j+1 are a subset of cells in columns >= j. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Type

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => { c // c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram lam mu } → Fin N

Docstring: A tableau of shape lam/mu is a function from cells to [N]. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → ℕ → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} T j i => Nat.card { c // T ⟨↑c, ⋯⟩ = i }

Docstring: The content of a restricted tableau col_{≥j}(T).
Counts occurrences of each value in columns j and beyond. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Set (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => {c | mu c.1 < c.2 ∧ c.2 ≤ lam c.1}

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(lam/mu) as a set of cells.
A cell (i,j) is in Y(lam/mu) if mu_i < j ≤ lam_i.

**This is the `Set` version with 1-indexed columns (textbook convention).**
The first column is j = 1, not j = 0.

For the canonical `Finset` version with 0-indexed columns, see:
- `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` in NPartition.lean (canonical, no `[NeZero N]` required)
- `skewYoungDiagram` in SchurBasics.lean (duplicate, requires `[NeZero N]`)

Comparison:
- Here: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i < j ≤ λ_i (1-indexed)
- NPartition/SchurBasics: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i ≤ j < λ_i (0-indexed)

The bijection between them is: (i, j) here ↔ (i, j-1) in NPartition/SchurBasics.
See `SchurBasics.mem_skewYoungDiagram_iff_mem_LR_shifted` for the conversion lemma. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.le
ℕ → ℕ → Prop

Docstring: Non-strict, or weak, inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the `≤` operator.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Add
Type u → Type u

Docstring: The homogeneous version of `HAdd`: `a + b : α` where `a b : α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Add.add
{α : Type u} → [self : Add α] → α → α → α

Body:
fun α [self : Add α] => self.1

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`. See `HAdd`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.add
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun x x_1 =>
  Nat.brecOn (motive := fun x => ℕ → ℕ) x_1
    (fun x f x_2 =>
      (match (motive := ℕ → (x : ℕ) → Nat.below (motive := fun x => ℕ → ℕ) x → ℕ) x_2, x with
        | a, Nat.zero => fun x => a
        | a, b.succ => fun x => (x.1 a).succ)
        f)
    x

Docstring: Addition of natural numbers, typically used via the `+` operator.

This function is overridden in both the kernel and the compiler to efficiently evaluate using the
arbitrary-precision arithmetic library. The definition provided here is the logical model.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Mem

fun {α} s a => s a

Docstring: Membership in a set 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.card
Type u_3 → ℕ

Body:
fun α => Cardinal.toNat (Cardinal.mk α)

Docstring: `Nat.card α` is the cardinality of `α` as a natural number.

Body:
fun α β self => self.1

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Content monotonicity under column restriction

\leanhelper  For any tableau $T$ of shape $\lambda /\mu $, row index $i$, and positive integer $j$: 

\[  \operatorname {cont}(\operatorname {col}_{\geq j+1} T)_i \; \leq \;  \operatorname {cont}(\operatorname {col}_{\geq j} T)_i.  \]

 That is, restricting to higher columns can only decrease the count of any entry.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.col-tab
def.sf.col-tab

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. Let $T$ be a tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $. Let $j$ be a positive integer. Then, $\operatorname {col}_{\geq j}T$ means the restriction of $T$ to columns $j,j+1,j+2,\ldots $ (that is, the result of removing the first $j-1$ columns from $T$). Formally speaking, this means the restriction of the map $T$ to the set $\left\{  \left( u,v\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \  \mid \  v\geq j\right\}  $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.content
def.sf.content

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. Let $T$ be a tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $. We define the \emph{content} of $T$ to be the $N$-tuple $\left( a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{N}\right) $, where

\[  a_{i}:=\left( \text{\#  of }i\text{'s in }T\right) =\left( \text{\#  of boxes }c\text{ of }T\text{ such that }T\left( c\right) =i\right) .  \]

 We denote this $N$-tuple by $\operatorname *{cont}T$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-tab
def.sf.skew-tab

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions such that $\mu \subseteq \lambda $. A \emph{Young tableau} of shape $\lambda /\mu $ means a way of filling the boxes of $Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ with elements of $\left[ N\right] $ (one element per box). Formally speaking, it is defined as a map $T:Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $. 

Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $ are often called \emph{skew Young tableaux}. 

If we don’t have $\mu \subseteq \lambda $, then we agree that there are no Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "discrepancies": [],
  "justification": "The formal conclusion is exactly the required monotonicity inequality: `contentColGeq T (j + 1) i \u2264 contentColGeq T j i`. The dependency describes `contentColGeq T j i` as counting occurrences of `i` in columns `j` and beyond, matching `cont(col_{\u2265 j} T)_i`. The formal theorem quantifies over every `j : \u2115`, whereas the blueprint only requires positive integers, so it is strictly more general. Likewise, arbitrary `lam mu : Fin N \u2192 \u2115` include the blueprint\u2019s nested `N`-partitions as a special case. `Tableau lam mu` is a map from the 1-indexed skew diagram to `Fin N`, matching a filling by the `N` possible entries up to the standard finite-index encoding."
