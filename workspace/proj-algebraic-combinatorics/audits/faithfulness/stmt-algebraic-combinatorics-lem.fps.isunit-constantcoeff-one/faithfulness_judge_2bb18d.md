## TARGET PowerSeries.isUnit_of_constantCoeff_eq_one (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_2} [inst : Field R] {f : PowerSeries R}, PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = 1 → IsUnit f

Docstring: An FPS with constant term 1 is invertible (a unit).
This is the well-definedness statement for `loder` in Definition 7.8.12 (def.fps.loder.1).

The proof: If `constantCoeff f = 1`, then `constantCoeff f` is a unit in `R`, so by
Proposition prop.fps.invertible, `f` is invertible in `R⟦X⟧`. 

## TARGET PowerSeries.mul_inv_cancel_of_constantCoeff_eq_one (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_2} [inst : Field R] {f : PowerSeries R}, PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = 1 → f * f⁻¹ = 1

Docstring: For FPS with constant term 1, we have `f * f⁻¹ = 1`.
This is a key property used in the definition of `loder`. 

## TARGET PowerSeries.constantCoeff_inv_of_constantCoeff_eq_one (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_2} [inst : Field R] {f : PowerSeries R},
  PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = 1 → PowerSeries.constantCoeff f⁻¹ = 1

Docstring: The inverse of an FPS with constant term 1 also has constant term 1. 

## TARGET PowerSeries.inv_mul_cancel_of_constantCoeff_eq_one (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_2} [inst : Field R] {f : PowerSeries R}, PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = 1 → f⁻¹ * f = 1

Docstring: For FPS with constant term 1, we have `f⁻¹ * f = 1`. 

## TARGET PowerSeries.isUnit_iff_constantCoeff_isUnit (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_2} [inst : Field R] {f : PowerSeries R}, IsUnit f ↔ IsUnit (PowerSeries.constantCoeff f)

Docstring: An FPS is invertible iff its constant coefficient is a unit.
This is a more general version of `isUnit_of_constantCoeff_eq_one`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Field
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A `Field` is a `CommRing` with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.

An instance of `Field K` includes maps `ratCast : ℚ → K` and `qsmul : ℚ → K → K`.
Those two fields are needed to implement the `DivisionRing K → Algebra ℚ K` instance since we need
to control the specific definitions for some special cases of `K` (in particular `K = ℚ` itself).
See also note [forgetful inheritance].

If the field has positive characteristic `p`, our division by zero convention forces
`ratCast (1 / p) = 1 / 0 = 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

## BASE-LIBRARY REF RingHom

Docstring: Bundled semiring homomorphisms; use this for bundled ring homomorphisms too.

This extends from both `MonoidHom` and `MonoidWithZeroHom` in order to put the fields in a
sensible order, even though `MonoidWithZeroHom` already extends `MonoidHom`.

Docstring: The constant coefficient of a formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF IsUnit
{M : Type u_1} → [Monoid M] → M → Prop

Docstring: An element `a : M` of a `Monoid` is a unit if it has a two-sided inverse.
The actual definition says that `a` is equal to some `u : Mˣ`, where
`Mˣ` is a bundled version of `IsUnit`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Iff
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: If and only if, or logical bi-implication. `a ↔ b` means that `a` implies `b` and vice versa.
By `propext`, this implies that `a` and `b` are equal and hence any expression involving `a`
is equivalent to the corresponding expression with `b` instead.

 * The recommended spelling of `↔` in identifiers is `iff`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<->` in identifiers is `iff` (prefer `↔` over `<->`).

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Invertibility of FPS with constant term 1

\leanhelper  If $[x^0]f = 1$, then $f$ is a unit in $K[\! [x ]\! ]$, i.e., $f \cdot f^{-1} = 1$ and $f^{-1} \cdot f = 1$. Moreover, $[x^0](f^{-1}) = 1$. More generally, $f$ is a unit iff $[x^0]f$ is a unit in $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.commring.inverse-2
def.commring.inverse

Let $L$ be a commutative ring. Let $a\in L$. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inverse} (or \emph{multiplicative inverse}) of $a$ means an element $b\in L$ such that $ab=ba=1$. 

\textbf{(b)} We say that $a$ is \emph{invertible} in $L$ (or a \emph{unit} of $L$) if $a$ has an inverse.

def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.hasconstanttermone
def.fps.HasConstantTermOne

\leanhelper  An FPS $f\in K[[x]]$ has \emph{constant term one} if $[x^0]f=1$. We write $f\in K[[x]]_1$ for this condition.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

Let $x$ denote the FPS $\left(0,1,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. In other words, let $x$ denote the FPS with $\left[x^{1}\right]x=1$ and $\left[x^{i}\right]x=0$ for all $i\neq 1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "Every target adds the binder `[inst : Field R]`, whereas the blueprint\u2019s supplied algebraic setting is a \u201ccommutative ring\u201d and its claims are valid for FPS over such a ring. A field is a mathematically stronger, contentful restriction, so the formal declarations only cover a narrowed class of coefficient rings. This affects all five targets, including the general claim `IsUnit f \u2194 IsUnit (PowerSeries.constantCoeff f)`. To make the package faithful, use `[CommRing R]` for the unit criterion and the constant-term-one invertibility result. For the three statements containing `f\u207b\u00b9`, the available dependency `PowerSeries.instInv` itself requires `[Field k]`; that dependency must be generalized to an inverse construction valid on the relevant unit FPS, or the conclusions should instead quantify an inverse `g` with `f * g = 1`, `g * f = 1`, and `constantCoeff g = 1`. Apart from the added `Field` restriction, the formal conclusions match the blueprint\u2019s unit, two cancellation identities, inverse constant coefficient, and iff criterion."
