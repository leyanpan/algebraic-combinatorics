{α : Type u_2} → (α → ℕ) → WeightedSet α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.trans
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → {γ : Sort w} → α ≃ β → β ≃ γ → α ≃ γ

Docstring: Composition of equivalences `e₁ : α ≃ β` and `e₂ : β ≃ γ`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.succFunEquiv
(α : Type u_1) → (n : ℕ) → (Fin (n + 1) → α) ≃ (Fin n → α) × α

Docstring: `Fin (n + 1) → α` and `(Fin n → α) × α` are equivalent. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.prodComm
(α : Type u_9) → (β : Type u_10) → α × β ≃ β × α

Docstring: Type product is commutative up to an equivalence: `α × β ≃ β × α`. This is `Prod.swap` as an
equivalence. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv
Sort u_1 → Sort u_2 → Sort (max (max 1 u_1) u_2)

Docstring: `α ≃ β` is the type of functions from `α → β` with a two-sided inverse. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

lem.gf-ws.pow-succ-equiv

\leanhelper  For any weighted set $A$ and any $n \in \mathbb {N}$, there is a canonical isomorphism of weighted sets $A^{n+1} \cong A \times A^n$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-a0000000001
a0000000001

Let $A$ be a weighted set. Then, $A^{k}$ (for $k\in \mathbb {N}$) means the weighted set $\underbrace{A\times A\times \cdots \times A}_{k\text{ times}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.summable
def.fps.summable

A (possibly infinite) family $\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ of FPSs is said to be \emph{summable} (or \emph{entrywise essentially finite}) if 

\[  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{, all but finitely many }i\in I\text{ satisfy }\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}=0.  \]

 In this case, the sum $\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}$ is defined to be the FPS with 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\left(\sum _{i\in I}\mathbf{a}_{i}\right) =\underbrace{\sum _{i\in I}\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}_{i}}_{\substack {\text{an essentially}\\ \text{finite sum}}} \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }n\in \mathbb {N}\text{.}  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.x
def.fps.x

Let $x$ denote the FPS $\left(0,1,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. In other words, let $x$ denote the FPS with $\left[x^{1}\right]x=1$ and $\left[x^{i}\right]x=0$ for all $i\neq 1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.gf-ws.prod
def.gf-ws.prod

Let $A$ and $B$ be two weighted sets. Then, the weighted set $A\times B$ is defined to be the Cartesian product of the sets $A$ and $B$ (that is, the set $\left\{  \left( a,b\right) \  \mid \  a\in A\text{ and }b\in B\right\}  $), with the weight function defined as follows: For any $\left( a,b\right) \in A\times B$, we set

\begin{equation}  \left\vert \left( a,b\right) \right\vert =\left\vert a\right\vert +\left\vert b\right\vert . \end{equation}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.gf-ws.weighted-sets
def.gf-ws.weighted-sets

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{weighted set} is a set $A$ equipped with a function $w:A\rightarrow \mathbb {N}$, which is called the \emph{weight function} of this weighted set. For each $a\in A$, the value $w\left( a\right) $ is denoted $\left\vert a\right\vert $ and is called the \emph{weight} of $a$ (in our weighted set). \medskip 

Usually, instead of explicitly specifying the weight function $w$ as a function, we will simply specify the weight $\left\vert a\right\vert $ for each $a\in A$. The weighted set consisting of the set $A$ and the weight function $w$ will be called $\left( A,w\right) $ or simply $A$ when the weight function $w$ is clear from the context. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} A weighted set $A$ is said to be \emph{finite-type} if for each $n\in \mathbb {N}$, there are only finitely many $a\in A$ having weight $\left\vert a\right\vert =n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $A$ is a finite-type weighted set, then the \emph{weight generating function} of $A$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \sum _{a\in A}x^{\left\vert a\right\vert }=\sum _{n\in \mathbb {N}}\left( \text{\#  of }a\in A\text{ having weight }n\right) \cdot x^{n}\in \mathbb {Z}\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] .  \]

 This FPS is denoted by $\overline{A}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} An \emph{isomorphism} between two weighted sets $A$ and $B$ means a bijection $\rho :A\rightarrow B$ that preserves the weight (i.e., each $a\in A$ satisfies $\left\vert \rho \left( a\right) \right\vert =\left\vert a\right\vert $). \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} We say that two weighted sets $A$ and $B$ are \emph{isomorphic} (this is written $A\cong B$) if there exists an isomorphism between $A$ and $B$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint says: \u201cFor any weighted set $A$ and any $n\\in\\mathbb N$, there is a canonical isomorphism of weighted sets $A^{n+1}\\cong A\\times A^n$.\u201d The elaborated signature quantifies over exactly these data, `{\u03b1 : Type u_2} \u2192 (W : WeightedSet \u03b1) \u2192 (n : \u2115)`, with no added hypotheses, and returns `(W.pow (n + 1)).Isomorphism (W \u00d7\u1d65 W.pow n)`. By the dependency bodies, `W.pow k` has carrier `Fin k \u2192 \u03b1` and weight `\u2211 i, W.weight (f i)`, matching the weighted Cartesian power, while `WeightedSet.prod` uses the sum of component weights. `WeightedSet.Isomorphism` is precisely a weight-preserving bijection. The body supplies the canonical coordinate decomposition: `Fin.succFunEquiv` identifies an `(n+1)`-tuple with an `n`-tuple and one element, and `Equiv.prodComm` reorders this to `\u03b1 \u00d7 (Fin n \u2192 \u03b1)`. Thus the formal definition constructs exactly the claimed canonical weighted-set isomorphism."
