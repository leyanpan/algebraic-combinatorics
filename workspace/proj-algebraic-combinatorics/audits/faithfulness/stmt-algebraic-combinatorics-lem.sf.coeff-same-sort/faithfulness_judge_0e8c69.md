Docstring: Coefficients are equal for exponents with the same sort (for symmetric polynomials).
This follows from the fact that two tuples with the same sort differ by a permutation,
and symmetric polynomials have permutation-invariant coefficients.

The proof requires the combinatorial fact that equal sorted multisets implies
the existence of a permutation relating the two tuples. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.NPartition (def)
ℕ → Type

Body:
fun N => NPartition N

Docstring: Alias for the canonical `NPartition` type within this namespace.
An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

All basic operations (`size`, `length`, `zero`, etc.) and lemmas are inherited
from the canonical `_root_.NPartition` definition in `NPartition.lean`.

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommSemiring
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative semiring is a semiring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.IsSymmetric
{σ : Type u_1} → {R : Type u_3} → [inst : CommSemiring R] → MvPolynomial σ R → Prop

Docstring: A `MvPolynomial φ` is symmetric if it is invariant under
permutations of its variables by the `rename` operation 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finsupp
Type u_9 → (M : Type u_10) → [Zero M] → Type (max u_10 u_9)

Docstring: `Finsupp α M`, denoted `α →₀ M`, is the type of functions `f : α → M` such that
`f x = 0` for all but finitely many `x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.coeff
{R : Type u} → {σ : Type u_1} → [inst : CommSemiring R] → (σ →₀ ℕ) → MvPolynomial σ R → R

Docstring: The coefficient of the monomial `m` in the multi-variable polynomial `p`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv
Sort u_1 → Sort u_2 → Sort (max (max 1 u_1) u_2)

Docstring: `α ≃ β` is the type of functions from `α → β` with a two-sided inverse. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.instEquivLike
{α : Sort u} → {β : Sort v} → EquivLike (α ≃ β) α β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finsupp.equivFunOnFinite
{α : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_4} → [inst : Zero M] → [Finite α] → (α →₀ M) ≃ (α → M)

Docstring: Given `Finite α`, `equivFunOnFinite` is the `Equiv` between `α →₀ β` and `α → β`.
(All functions on a finite type are finitely supported.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is antitone if `a ≤ b` implies `f b ≤ f a`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PartialOrder.toPreorder
{α : Type u_2} → [self : PartialOrder α] → Preorder α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.instPartialOrder
{n : ℕ} → PartialOrder (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instPreorder
Preorder ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.

      [DecidableRel r] → [IsTrans α r] → [Std.Antisymm r] → [Std.Total r] → List α

Docstring: `sort s` constructs a sorted list from the multiset `s`.
(Uses merge sort algorithm.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type v} → (α → β) → Multiset α → Multiset β

Docstring: `map f s` is the lift of the list `map` operation. The multiplicity
of `b` in `map f s` is the number of `a ∈ s` (counting multiplicity)
such that `f a = b`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.val
{α : Type u_4} → Finset α → Multiset α

Docstring: The underlying multiset 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.val
{n : ℕ} → Fin n → ℕ

Docstring: The number that is strictly less than `n`.

`Fin.val` is a coercion, so any `Fin n` can be used in a position where a `Nat` is expected.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 5 < 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.coeff-same-sort

\leanhelper  Let $f \in \mathcal{P}$ be symmetric. If two exponent tuples $d_1$ and $d_2$ satisfy $\operatorname {sort}(d_1) = \operatorname {sort}(d_2)$, then $[x^{d_1}] f = [x^{d_2}] f$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.sf.kn
conv.sf.KN

Fix a commutative ring $K$. Fix an $N\in \mathbb {N}$. Throughout this chapter, we will keep $K$ and $N$ fixed. Let $S_N$ denote the symmetric group, i.e., the group of all permutations of $[N] := \{ 1,2,\ldots ,N\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.monomial
def.sf.monomial

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{monomial} is an expression of the form $x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ with $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N \in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{degree} $\deg \mathfrak {m}$ of a monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is defined to be $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_N \in \mathbb {N}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} A monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is said to be \emph{squarefree} if $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N \in \{ 0,1\} $. (This is saying that no square or higher power of an indeterminate appears in $\mathfrak {m}$; thus the name “squarefree”.) \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} A monomial $\mathfrak {m} = x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_N^{a_N}$ is said to be \emph{primal} if there is at most one $i \in [N]$ satisfying $a_i > 0$. (This is saying that the monomial $\mathfrak {m}$ contains no two distinct indeterminates. Thus, a primal monomial is just $1$ or a power of an indeterminate.)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ps
def.sf.PS

\textbf{(a)} Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the polynomial ring $K[x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N]$ in $N$ variables over $K$. This is not just a ring; it is a commutative $K$-algebra. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The symmetric group $S_N$ acts on the set $\mathcal{P}$ according to the formula 

\[  \sigma \cdot f = f[x_{\sigma (1)}, x_{\sigma (2)}, \ldots , x_{\sigma (N)}] \quad \text{for any } \sigma \in S_N \text{ and any } f \in \mathcal{P}.  \]

 Here, $f[a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N]$ means the result of substituting $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_N$ for the indeterminates $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_N$ in a polynomial $f \in \mathcal{P}$. 

Roughly speaking, the group $S_N$ is thus acting on $\mathcal{P}$ by permuting variables: A permutation $\sigma \in S_N$ transforms a polynomial $f$ by substituting $x_{\sigma (i)}$ for each $x_i$. 

Note that this action of $S_N$ on $\mathcal{P}$ is a well-defined group action (as we will see in Proposition~ \ref{prop.sf.SN-acts} below). \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} A polynomial $f \in \mathcal{P}$ is said to be \emph{symmetric} if it satisfies 

\[  \sigma \cdot f = f \quad \text{for all } \sigma \in S_N.  \]

\textbf{(d)} We let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all symmetric polynomials $f \in \mathcal{P}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.sort
def.sf.sort

Let $a=\left( a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$. Then: 

\textbf{(a)} We let $x^{a}$ denote the monomial $x_{1}^{a_{1}}x_{2}^{a_{2}}\cdots x_{N}^{a_{N}}$. 

\textbf{(b)} We let $\operatorname *{sort}a$ mean the $N$-partition obtained from $a$ by sorting the entries of $a$ in weakly decreasing order.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint says: \u201cLet $f\\in\\mathcal P$ be symmetric. If two exponent tuples $d_1,d_2$ satisfy $\\operatorname{sort}(d_1)=\\operatorname{sort}(d_2)$, then $[x^{d_1}]f=[x^{d_2}]f$.\u201d The target states exactly this via `f.IsSymmetric`, the hypothesis `sortTupleFinsupp d\u2081 = sortTupleFinsupp d\u2082`, and the conclusion `MvPolynomial.coeff d\u2081 f = MvPolynomial.coeff d\u2082 f`. Here `Fin N \u2192\u2080 \u2115` represents an $N$-tuple because `Fin N` is finite, and `sortTupleFinsupp` converts it to a function and sorts all entries weakly decreasingly, matching the informal `sort`. The formal binder `[CommSemiring R]` is weaker than the blueprint\u2019s fixed commutative-ring assumption, so the theorem is strictly more general rather than weaker; every commutative ring is covered. Quantifying over `R` and `N` likewise implies the statement for the blueprint\u2019s fixed $K$ and $N$."
