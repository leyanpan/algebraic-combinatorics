## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.InclusionExclusion.Derangement (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
Type u_1 → Type (max 0 u_1)

Body:
fun α => { σ // ∀ (x : α), σ x ≠ x }

Docstring: **Definition `def.pie.dera`**: A derangement of a type `α` is a permutation with no fixed points.

This is definitionally equal to `↥(derangements α)` from `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Derangements.Basic`.

**Textbook definition:** "A derangement of a set X means a permutation of X that has no fixed points."

**Examples from the textbook:**
- D₀ = 1: The identity on ∅ is a derangement (vacuously no fixed points)
- D₁ = 0: The identity on {0} fixes 0, so it's not a derangement
- D₂ = 1: Only the swap (0 1) is a derangement
- D₃ = 2: The two 3-cycles (0 1 2) and (0 2 1) are derangements 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF EquivLike.toFunLike
{E : Sort u_1} → {α : Sort u_3} → {β : Sort u_4} → [EquivLike E α β] → FunLike E α β

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.pie.dera

A \emph{derangement} of a set $X$ means a permutation of $X$ that has no fixed points.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target defines, for every type `\u03b1`, the subtype `{ \u03c3 // \u2200 (x : \u03b1), \u03c3 x \u2260 x }`, where `\u03c3` is a permutation (`Equiv.Perm \u03b1`, whose docstring says it is a bijection from `\u03b1` to itself). Thus its elements are exactly permutations of `\u03b1` satisfying \u201cfor every `x`, `\u03c3 x \u2260 x`,\u201d i.e. having no fixed points. This matches the blueprint: \u201ca permutation of `X` that has no fixed points.\u201d Representing the underlying set `X` by its carrier type `\u03b1` introduces no mathematically substantive restriction."
