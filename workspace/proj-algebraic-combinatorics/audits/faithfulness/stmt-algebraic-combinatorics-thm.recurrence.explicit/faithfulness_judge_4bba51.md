## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.exampleRecurrence_explicit (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n : ℕ), AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.exampleRecurrence n = 2 ^ (n + 1) - (n + 1)

Docstring: The explicit formula: $a_n = 2^{n+1} - (n+1)$. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.exampleRecurrence (def)
ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun x =>
  Nat.brecOn x fun x f =>
    (match (motive := (x : ℕ) → Nat.below x → ℕ) x with
      | 0 => fun x => 1
      | n.succ => fun x => 2 * x.1 + n)
      f

Docstring: The sequence defined by $a_0 = 1$ and $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + n$. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HPow.hPow
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HPow α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a ^ b` computes `a` to the power of `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `^` in identifiers is `pow`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.succ
ℕ → ℕ

Docstring: The successor of a natural number `n`.

Using `Nat.succ n` should usually be avoided in favor of `n + 1`, which is the [simp normal
form](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/4.28.0/find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=simp-normal-forms).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies exactly as required, `\u2200 (n : \u2115)`, and concludes `exampleRecurrence n = 2 ^ (n + 1) - (n + 1)`, matching \u201cFor all n\u2208\u2115, a_n = 2^{n+1} - (n+1).\u201d The dependency `exampleRecurrence` implements the stated sequence: at `0` it returns `1`, and at `n.succ` it returns `2 * x.1 + n`, where the recursive predecessor value `x.1` is a_n, matching `a_{n+1} = 2a_n + n`. Although formal subtraction is natural-number subtraction and hence truncated, this causes no semantic difference here because `2^(n+1) \u2265 n+1` for every natural n."
