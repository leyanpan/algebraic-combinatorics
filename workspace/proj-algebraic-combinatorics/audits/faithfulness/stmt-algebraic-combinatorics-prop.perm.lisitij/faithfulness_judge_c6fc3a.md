## TARGET Equiv.Perm.length_mul_transposition (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (i j : Fin n),
  i < j →
    (σ * Equiv.swap i j).length =
      if σ j < σ i then σ.length - 2 * (σ.setQ i j).card - 1 else σ.length + 2 * (σ.setR i j).card + 1

Docstring: **Proposition prop.perm.lisitij (b)**: The exact formula for length change:
- If σ(i) > σ(j): ℓ(σ·t_{i,j}) = ℓ(σ) - 2|Q| - 1
- If σ(i) < σ(j): ℓ(σ·t_{i,j}) = ℓ(σ) + 2|R| + 1

where Q and R are the sets of "intermediate" elements. 

## TARGET Equiv.Perm.length_mul_transposition_compare (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {n : ℕ} (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (i j : Fin n),
  i < j → (σ j < σ i → (σ * Equiv.swap i j).length < σ.length) ∧ (σ i < σ j → σ.length < (σ * Equiv.swap i j).length)

Docstring: **Proposition prop.perm.lisitij (a)**: For a transposition t_{i,j} with i < j:
- ℓ(σ·t_{i,j}) < ℓ(σ) if σ(i) > σ(j)
- ℓ(σ·t_{i,j}) > ℓ(σ) if σ(i) < σ(j)

The length decreases if (i,j) was an inversion, increases if it wasn't.

This follows immediately from part (b): when σ(i) > σ(j), the formula gives
ℓ(σ·t_{i,j}) = ℓ(σ) - 2|Q| - 1 < ℓ(σ), and when σ(i) < σ(j), the formula gives
ℓ(σ·t_{i,j}) = ℓ(σ) + 2|R| + 1 > ℓ(σ). 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.length (def)

Body:
fun {n} σ => σ.inversions.card

Docstring: The length of a permutation is the number of its inversions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.setQ (def)

Body:
fun {n} σ i j => {k | i < k ∧ k < j ∧ σ j < σ k ∧ σ k < σ i}

Docstring: The set Q from Proposition prop.perm.lisitij:
Q = {k ∈ {i+1, ..., j-1} | σ(i) > σ(k) > σ(j)}
This counts elements between i and j whose images are strictly between σ(j) and σ(i). 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY Equiv.Perm.setR (def)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

Docstring: `swap a b` is the permutation that swaps `a` and `b` and
leaves other values as is. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.

{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function.

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd

## INFORMAL STATEMENT

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_n$. Let $i$ and $j$ be two elements of $[n]$ such that $i < j$. Then: \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} We have $\ell (\sigma t_{i,j}) < \ell (\sigma )$ if $\sigma (i) > \sigma (j)$. We have $\ell (\sigma t_{i,j}) > \ell (\sigma )$ if $\sigma (i) < \sigma (j)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} We have 

\[  \ell (\sigma t_{i,j}) = \begin{cases}  \ell (\sigma ) - 2|Q| - 1, &  \text{if } \sigma (i) > \sigma (j); \\ \ell (\sigma ) + 2|R| + 1, &  \text{if } \sigma (i) < \sigma (j), \end{cases}  \]

 where 

\begin{align*}  Q & = \{ k \in \{ i+1, i+2, \ldots , j-1\}  \mid \sigma (i) > \sigma (k) > \sigma (j)\}  \quad \text{and} \\ R & = \{ k \in \{ i+1, i+2, \ldots , j-1\}  \mid \sigma (i) < \sigma (k) < \sigma (j)\} . \end{align*}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.tij
def.perm.tij

Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct elements of a set $X$. 

Then, the \emph{transposition} $t_{i,j}$ is the permutation of $X$ that sends $i$ to $j$, sends $j$ to $i$, and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unclear",
  "justification": "Both targets use the crucial term `\u03c3 * Equiv.swap i j`, while the blueprint fixes multiplication explicitly: \u201cwe will write `\u03b1 \u03b2` for the composition `\u03b1 \u2218 \u03b2`,\u201d so `\u03c3 t_{i,j}` must act as `\u03c3 \u2218 t_{i,j}`. The package gives only `Equiv.Perm.instMul : Mul (Equiv.Perm \u03b1)` and the generic statement that the meaning of `*` is type-dependent; it does not provide the instance body or a permutation-specific multiplication docstring. Hence it is impossible from the package to determine whether `\u03c3 * Equiv.swap i j` means `\u03c3 \u2218 swap i j` or the opposite composition. This affects both `length_mul_transposition` and `length_mul_transposition_compare`, not merely notation. If the instance implements `(\u03c3 * \u03c4)(x) = \u03c3(\u03c4(x))`, the declarations faithfully encode parts (b) and (a), respectively; if it implements `(\u03c3 * \u03c4)(x) = \u03c4(\u03c3(x))`, they drift, and the product would need to be reversed to `Equiv.swap i j * \u03c3`. The package needs the body or a composition-orientation theorem/docstring for `Equiv.Perm.instMul` to decide."
