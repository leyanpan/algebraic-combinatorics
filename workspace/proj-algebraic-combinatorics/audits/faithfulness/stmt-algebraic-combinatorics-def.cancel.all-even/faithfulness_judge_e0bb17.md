## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.IsAllEven (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{n d : ℕ} → (Fin n → Fin d) → Prop

Body:
fun {n d} x => ∀ (k : Fin d), Even {i | x i = k}.card

Docstring: An n-tuple `x : Fin n → Fin d` is "all-even" if each element of `Fin d`
occurs an even number of times. For example, the 4-tuple `(1,4,4,1)` is all-even
since 1 appears twice and 4 appears twice.

Label: Definition from Theorem `thm.cancel.all-even` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Even
{α : Type u_2} → [Add α] → α → Prop

Docstring: An element `a` of a type `α` with addition satisfies `Even a` if `a = r + r`,
for some `r : α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.cancel.all-even

\leanhelper  Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $d\in \mathbb {N}$. An $n$-tuple $\left( x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\right) \in \left[ d\right] ^{n}$ is said to be \emph{all-even} if each element of $\left[ d\right] $ occurs an even number of times in this $n$-tuple (i.e., if for each $k\in \left[ d\right] $, the number of all $i\in \left[ n\right] $ satisfying $x_{i}=k$ is even).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint defines all-even by requiring that \u201cfor each $k\\in[d]$, the number of all $i\\in[n]$ satisfying $x_i=k$ is even.\u201d The Lean body states exactly `\u2200 (k : Fin d), Even {i | x i = k}.card` for `x : Fin n \u2192 Fin d`: `Fin n` and `Fin d` are canonical finite types with respectively `n` and `d` elements, and `{i | x i = k}.card` counts precisely the indices satisfying the equality. The shift from the blueprint\u2019s labels `{1,\u2026,n}` and `{1,\u2026,d}` to `Fin n` and `Fin d` (zero-based representatives) is only a relabeling and does not alter the occurrence-count property. `Even` on `\u2115` means the cardinality is twice a natural number, matching an even number of occurrences."
