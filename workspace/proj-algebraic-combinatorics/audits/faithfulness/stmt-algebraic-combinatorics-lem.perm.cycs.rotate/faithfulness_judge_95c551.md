## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc_rotate (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {X : Type u_1} [inst : DecidableEq X] {l : List X},
  l.Nodup → ∀ (n : ℕ), AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc (l.rotate n) = AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc l

Docstring: Cyclic rotation of the list doesn't change the cycle.
This formalizes the textbook statement that 
`cyc_{i₁,i₂,...,iₖ} = cyc_{i₂,i₃,...,iₖ,i₁} = ... = cyc_{iₖ,i₁,...,iₖ₋₁}`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.cyc (def)
{X : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq X] → List X → Equiv.Perm X

Body:
fun {X} [DecidableEq X] l => l.formPerm

Docstring: The k-cycle `cyc_{i₁, i₂, ..., iₖ}` is the permutation that sends
`i₁ ↦ i₂ ↦ i₃ ↦ ... ↦ iₖ ↦ i₁` and fixes all other elements.
(def.perm.cycs)

This is the constructive definition from the textbook. In Mathlib,
this is `List.formPerm`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.Nodup
{α : Type u} → List α → Prop

Docstring: The list has no duplicates: it contains every element at most once.

It is defined as `Pairwise (· ≠ ·)`: each element is unequal to all other elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.rotate
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ → List α

Docstring: `rotate l n` rotates the elements of `l` to the left by `n`
```
rotate [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 2 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1]
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.formPerm
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → List α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: A list `l : List α` can be interpreted as an `Equiv.Perm α` where each element in the list
is permuted to the next one, defined as `formPerm`. When we have that `Nodup l`,
we prove that `Equiv.Perm.support (formPerm l) = l.toFinset`, and that
`formPerm l` is rotationally invariant, in `formPerm_rotate`.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.perm.cycs.rotate

\leanhelper  Cyclic rotation of the list does not change the cycle: $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k} = \operatorname {cyc}_{i_2, i_3, \ldots , i_k, i_1} = \cdots = \operatorname {cyc}_{i_k, i_1, \ldots , i_{k-1}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs
def.perm.cycs

Let $X$ be a set. Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k$ be $k$ distinct elements of $X$. Then, 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}  \]

 means the permutation of $X$ that sends 

\begin{align*} & i_1 \text{ to } i_2, \\ & i_2 \text{ to } i_3, \\ & \ldots , \\ & i_{k-1} \text{ to } i_k, \\ & i_k \text{ to } i_1 \end{align*}

 and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged. In other words, $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}$ means the permutation of $X$ that satisfies 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, \ldots , i_k}(p) = \begin{cases}  i_{j+1}, &  \text{if } p = i_j \text{ for some } j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} ;\\ p, &  \text{otherwise} \end{cases}  \]

 for every $p \in X$, where $i_{k+1}$ means $i_1$. 

This permutation is called a $k$\emph{-cycle}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint assumes \u201c$i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_k$ [are] $k$ distinct elements,\u201d exactly represented by the target binder `l.Nodup`. The conclusion `\u2200 (n : \u2115), cyc (l.rotate n) = cyc l`, together with `List.rotate` being left rotation, proves every cyclic shift in the displayed chain; quantifying over all natural `n` is at least as general as listing the $k$ rotations. The dependency `cyc l := l.formPerm` has the documented meaning of sending each listed element to the next and fixing all others, matching `def.perm.cycs`. The binder `[DecidableEq X]` is required by this constructive representation of `List.formPerm` and is an encoding requirement rather than an additional mathematical hypothesis."
