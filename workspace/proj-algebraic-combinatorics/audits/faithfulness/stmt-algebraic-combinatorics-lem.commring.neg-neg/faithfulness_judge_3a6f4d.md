Body:
fun α [self : Neg α] => self.1

Docstring: `-a` computes the negative or opposite of `a`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `neg` (when used as a unary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SubtractionMonoid

Docstring: A `SubtractionMonoid` is a `SubNegMonoid` with involutive negation and such that
`-(a + b) = -b + -a` and `a + b = 0 → -a = b`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SubNegMonoid
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A `SubNegMonoid` is an `AddMonoid` with unary `-` and binary `-` operations
satisfying `sub_eq_add_neg : ∀ a b, a - b = a + -b`.

The default for `sub` is such that `a - b = a + -b` holds by definition.

Adding `sub` as a field rather than defining `a - b := a + -b` allows us to
avoid certain classes of unification failures, for example:
Let `foo X` be a type with a `∀ X, Sub (Foo X)` instance but no
`∀ X, Neg (Foo X)`. Suppose we also have an instance
`∀ X [Cromulent X], AddGroup (Foo X)`. Then the `(-)` coming from
`AddGroup.sub` cannot be definitionally equal to the `(-)` coming from
`Foo.Sub`.

In the same way, adding a `zsmul` field makes it possible to avoid definitional failures
in diamonds. See the definition of `AddMonoid` and Note [forgetful inheritance] for more
explanations on this.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SubtractionMonoid.neg_eq_of_add
∀ {G : Type u} [self : SubtractionMonoid G] (a b : G), a + b = 0 → -a = b

Docstring: Despite the asymmetry of `neg_eq_of_add`, the symmetric version is true thanks to the
involutivity of negation.

Docstring: Addition is commutative in a commutative additive magma.

Docstring: A Lie ring is an additive group with compatible product, known as the bracket, satisfying the
Jacobi identity.

Docstring: An associative ring gives rise to a Lie ring by taking the bracket to be the ring commutator. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.commring.neg-neg

\leanhelper  Let $K$ be a commutative ring. For any $a\in K$, we have $-\left( -a\right) =a$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "discrepancies": [],
  "justification": "The elaborated theorem quantifies over exactly the intended setting, `\u2200 {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] (a : K)`, and concludes exactly `- -a = a`, matching \u201cLet K be a commutative ring. For any a\u2208K, we have \u2212(\u2212a)=a.\u201d Lean\u2019s `CommRing` is the standard encoding of the informally axiomatized commutative ring; its unary negation is the additive inverse induced by the informal subtraction operation. Thus the notational/axiomatic presentation does not change the claim."
