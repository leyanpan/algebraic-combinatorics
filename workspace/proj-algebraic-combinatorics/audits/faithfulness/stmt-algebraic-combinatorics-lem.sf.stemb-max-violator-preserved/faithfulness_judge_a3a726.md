          AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition (nu + AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq T (j + 1))

Docstring: When j is the max violator column, j+1 gives an N-partition (or is out of range).
This is the key hypothesis needed for benderKnuthPrefixMatching_involutive_stembridge.

Note: This lemma requires `hnu : IsNPartition nu` to handle the edge case where
j = maxCol + 1 and contentColGeq T (j+1) = 0. In that case, we need to show
IsNPartition nu, which is given by hypothesis. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {N} lam => IsNPartition lam

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of natural numbers.
(Used throughout the source)

This is an alias for the canonical definition in `NPartition.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Type

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => { c // c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram lam mu } → Fin N

Docstring: A tableau of shape lam/mu is a function from cells to [N]. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsSemistandard (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → Prop

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} T =>
  (∀ (c₁ c₂ : { c // c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram lam mu }),
      (↑c₁).1 = (↑c₂).1 → (↑c₁).2 < (↑c₂).2 → T c₁ ≤ T c₂) ∧
    ∀ (c₁ c₂ : { c // c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram lam mu }),
      (↑c₁).2 = (↑c₂).2 → (↑c₁).1 < (↑c₂).1 → T c₁ < T c₂

Docstring: A tableau is semistandard if entries weakly increase along rows
and strictly increase down columns. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.violatorColumns (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → Finset ℕ

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} nu T =>
  have maxCol := Finset.univ.sup lam;
  {j ∈ Finset.range (maxCol + 2) | j > 0 ∧ ¬AlgebraicCombinatorics.isPartitionAtColumn nu T j}

Docstring: The set of columns where ν + cont(col_{≥j}(T)) fails to be a partition.

Note: We use `maxCol + 2` in the range to ensure that `j = maxCol + 1` is included.
This is important because for `j > maxCol`, `contentColGeq T j = 0`, so we're checking
if `nu` itself is an N-partition. Without this, the lemma
`violatorColumns_nonempty_of_not_yamanouchi` would fail when `nu` is not an N-partition
but `nu + contentColGeq T j` is an N-partition for all `j ≤ maxCol`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → ℕ → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} T j i => Nat.card { c // T ⟨↑c, ⋯⟩ = i }

Docstring: The content of a restricted tableau col_{≥j}(T).
Counts occurrences of each value in columns j and beyond. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY IsNPartition (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {N} lam => ∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → lam j ≤ lam i

Docstring: An N-partition predicate: an N-tuple is an N-partition if it is weakly decreasing.
This is equivalent to `Antitone` for functions `Fin N → ℕ`.
(Used throughout the source) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Set (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => {c | mu c.1 < c.2 ∧ c.2 ≤ lam c.1}

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(lam/mu) as a set of cells.
A cell (i,j) is in Y(lam/mu) if mu_i < j ≤ lam_i.

**This is the `Set` version with 1-indexed columns (textbook convention).**
The first column is j = 1, not j = 0.

For the canonical `Finset` version with 0-indexed columns, see:
- `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` in NPartition.lean (canonical, no `[NeZero N]` required)
- `skewYoungDiagram` in SchurBasics.lean (duplicate, requires `[NeZero N]`)

Comparison:
- Here: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i < j ≤ λ_i (1-indexed)
- NPartition/SchurBasics: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i ≤ j < λ_i (0-indexed)

The bijection between them is: (i, j) here ↔ (i, j-1) in NPartition/SchurBasics.
See `SchurBasics.mem_skewYoungDiagram_iff_mem_LR_shifted` for the conversion lemma. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.isPartitionAtColumn (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → ℕ → Prop

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} nu T j => AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition (nu + AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentColGeq T j)

Docstring: Check if ν + cont(col_{≥j}(T)) is an N-partition. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.isPartitionAtColumn_decidable (def)
{N : ℕ} →
  {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} →
    (nu : Fin N → ℕ) →
      (T : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu) →
        (j : ℕ) → Decidable (AlgebraicCombinatorics.isPartitionAtColumn nu T j)

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} nu T j => id (id inferInstance)

Docstring: Decidability of isPartitionAtColumn. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY IsNPartition.instDecidable (def)
{N : ℕ} → (lam : Fin N → ℕ) → Decidable (IsNPartition lam)

Body:
fun {N} lam => inferInstanceAs (Decidable (∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → lam j ≤ lam i))

Docstring: `IsNPartition` is decidable since it's a finite conjunction of decidable inequalities. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.Nonempty
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → Prop

Docstring: The property `s.Nonempty` expresses the fact that the finset `s` is not empty. It should be used
in theorem assumptions instead of `∃ x, x ∈ s` or `s ≠ ∅` as it gives access to a nice API thanks
to the dot notation. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.max'
{α : Type u_2} → [LinearOrder α] → (s : Finset α) → s.Nonempty → α

Docstring: Given a nonempty finset `s` in a linear order `α`, then `s.max' H` is its maximum, as an
element of `α`, where `H` is a proof of nonemptiness. Without this assumption, use instead `s.max`,
taking values in `WithBot α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instLinearOrder
LinearOrder ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Pi.instAdd
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : ι → Type u_5} → [(i : ι) → Add (M i)] → Add ((i : ι) → M i)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

{n : ℕ} → LE (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sup
{α : Type u_2} → {β : Type u_3} → [inst : SemilatticeSup α] → [OrderBot α] → Finset β → (β → α) → α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Lattice.toSemilatticeSup
{α : Type u} → [self : Lattice α] → SemilatticeSup α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instLattice

`ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrderBot` and marked as noncomputable. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instOrderBot
OrderBot ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GT.gt
{α : Type u} → [LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a > b` is an abbreviation for `b < a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `>` in identifiers is `gt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLt
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n < m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLT Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 4 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `(if 6 < 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.card

Docstring: `Nat.card α` is the cardinality of `α` as a natural number.
If `α` is infinite, `Nat.card α = 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → (val : α) → p val → Subtype p

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable
Prop → Type

Docstring: Either a proof that `p` is true or a proof that `p` is false. This is equivalent to a `Bool` paired
with a proof that the `Bool` is `true` if and only if `p` is true.

`Decidable` instances are primarily used via `if`-expressions and the tactic `decide`. In
conditional expressions, the `Decidable` instance for the proposition is used to select a branch. At
run time, this case distinction code is identical to that which would be generated for a
`Bool`-based conditional. In proofs, the tactic `decide` synthesizes an instance of `Decidable p`,
attempts to reduce it to `isTrue h`, and then succeeds with the proof `h` if it can.

Because `Decidable` carries data, when writing `@[simp]` lemmas which include a `Decidable` instance
on the LHS, it is best to use `{_ : Decidable p}` rather than `[Decidable p]` so that non-canonical
instances can be found via unification rather than instance synthesis.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF id
{α : Sort u} → α → α

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstance
{α : Sort u} → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstance` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This function has the same type signature as the identity
function, but the square brackets on the `[i : α]` argument means that it will
attempt to construct this argument by typeclass inference. (This will fail if
`α` is not a `class`.) Example:
```
#check (inferInstance : Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat

def foo : Inhabited (Nat × Nat) :=
  inferInstance

example : foo.default = (default, default) :=
  rfl
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstanceAs
(α : Sort u) → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstanceAs α` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This is just like `inferInstance` except that `α` is given
explicitly instead of being inferred from the target type. It is especially
useful when the target type is some `α'` which is definitionally equal to `α`,
but the instance we are looking for is only registered for `α` (because
typeclass search does not unfold most definitions, but definitional equality
does.) Example:
```
#check inferInstanceAs (Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat
```

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Max violator column is preserved

\leanhelper  Let $j$ be the maximum violator column for $T$. Then $\nu + \operatorname {cont}(\operatorname {col}_{\geq j+1} T)$ is an $N$-partition. (This is because $j{+}1$ is \emph{not} a violator column, being larger than the maximum.) If $j{+}1$ exceeds all column indices, the result reduces to $\nu $ being a partition.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.col-tab
def.sf.col-tab

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. Let $T$ be a tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $. Let $j$ be a positive integer. Then, $\operatorname {col}_{\geq j}T$ means the restriction of $T$ to columns $j,j+1,j+2,\ldots $ (that is, the result of removing the first $j-1$ columns from $T$). Formally speaking, this means the restriction of the map $T$ to the set $\left\{  \left( u,v\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \  \mid \  v\geq j\right\}  $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.content
def.sf.content

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. Let $T$ be a tableau of shape $\lambda /\mu $. We define the \emph{content} of $T$ to be the $N$-tuple $\left( a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{N}\right) $, where

\[  a_{i}:=\left( \text{\#  of }i\text{'s in }T\right) =\left( \text{\#  of boxes }c\text{ of }T\text{ such that }T\left( c\right) =i\right) .  \]

 We denote this $N$-tuple by $\operatorname *{cont}T$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-ssyt
def.sf.skew-ssyt

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. 

A Young tableau $T$ of shape $\lambda /\mu $ is said to be \emph{semistandard} if its entries 

\begin{itemize} \item increase weakly along each row (from left to right); 

\item increase strictly down each column (from top to bottom). 

\end{itemize}

Formally speaking, this means that a Young tableau $T:Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $ is semistandard if and only if 

\begin{itemize} \item we have $T\left( i,j\right) \leq T\left( i,j+1\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ satisfying $\left( i,j+1\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $; 

\item we have $T\left( i,j\right) <T\left( i+1,j\right) $ for any $\left( i,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ satisfying $\left( i+1,j\right) \in Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $. 

\end{itemize}

We let $\operatorname *{SSYT}\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ denote the set of all semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-tab
def.sf.skew-tab

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions such that $\mu \subseteq \lambda $. A \emph{Young tableau} of shape $\lambda /\mu $ means a way of filling the boxes of $Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ with elements of $\left[ N\right] $ (one element per box). Formally speaking, it is defined as a map $T:Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) \rightarrow \left[ N\right] $. 

Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $ are often called \emph{skew Young tableaux}. 

If we don’t have $\mu \subseteq \lambda $, then we agree that there are no Young tableaux of shape $\lambda /\mu $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.stemb-violator-misstep
Violator columns and misstep indices

\leanhelper  Let $T$ be a semistandard tableau and $\nu $ an $N$-tuple. A positive integer $j$ is a \emph{violator column} if $\nu + \operatorname {cont}(\operatorname {col}_{\geq j} T)$ is not an $N$-partition. An index $k$ is a \emph{misstep} for an $N$-tuple $\alpha $ if $k + 1 < N$ and $\alpha _k < \alpha _{k+1}$ (i.e., the partition condition fails at~ $k$).

  "justification": "The conclusion exactly matches the blueprint: the target proves `IsNPartition (nu + contentColGeq T (j + 1))`, where `j := (violatorColumns nu T).max' hviolator`, corresponding to \u201cLet j be the maximum violator column \u2026 Then \u03bd + cont(col_{\u2265 j+1} T) is an N-partition.\u201d Although the signature includes `IsNPartition nu`, this is not a substantive restriction on the blueprint\u2019s cases: with violators defined over all positive columns, existence of a maximum violator already forces \u03bd to be a partition, since beyond every tableau column the restricted content is zero and otherwise every sufficiently large column would remain a violator. Formally, this hypothesis also makes the finite cutoff in `violatorColumns`, namely `j \u2208 Finset.range (maxCol + 2)`, faithfully represent all possible violators: columns beyond the tableau have zero content and are nonviolators. The omitted assumptions that \u03bb and \u03bc are partitions (and form a valid skew shape) only make the Lean theorem more general, which is permitted."
