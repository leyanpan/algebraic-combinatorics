## TARGET SymmetricFunctions.lgv_pathWeightSum_eq_hsymmExt (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {N : ℕ} {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] (a c : ℤ),
  0 < N →
    LGV.pathWeightSum LGV.integerLattice_pathFinite SymmetricFunctions.jacobiTrudiArcWeight (a, 1) (c, ↑N) =
      SymmetricFunctions.hsymmExt (c - a)

Docstring: Key infrastructure lemma: The LGV path weight sum from (a, 1) to (c, N) with
jacobiTrudiArcWeight equals hsymmExt(c - a).

This connects the LGV framework (using SimpleDigraph.Path in integerLattice)
to our LatticePath representation (using eastStepHeights).

The proof uses lgv_pathWeightSum_eq_latticePathSum to establish a weight-preserving
bijection between LGV paths and LatticePaths, then applies pathWeightSum_eq_hsymm.

This is a key infrastructure lemma needed for det_jacobiTrudiMatrixH_eq_nipatSum.

Docstring: The integer lattice digraph ℤ².

This is the same lattice as in LGV1.lean, but using `SimpleDigraph` instead of

Docstring: The arc weight function for the Jacobi-Trudi proof.
East-steps at height j (where 1 ≤ j ≤ N) are weighted by X_{j-1}.

Docstring: The path is nonempty 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommSemiring
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → CommSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqProd
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq α] → [DecidableEq β] → DecidableEq (α × β)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDecidableEq
DecidableEq ℤ

Docstring: Decides whether two integers are equal. Usually accessed via the `DecidableEq Int` instance.

This function is overridden by the compiler with an efficient implementation. This definition is the
logical model.

Examples:
* `show (7 : Int) = (3 : Int) + (4 : Int) by decide`
* `if (6 : Int) = (3 : Int) * (2 : Int) then "yes" else "no" = "yes"`
* `(¬ (6 : Int) = (3 : Int)) = true`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instNatCastInt
NatCast ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring.toAddCommMonoid
{α : Type u} → [self : NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring α] → AddCommMonoid α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF NonUnitalNonAssocRing.toNonUnitalNonAssocSemiring
{α : Type u} → [self : NonUnitalNonAssocRing α] → NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF NonUnitalNonAssocCommRing.toNonUnitalNonAssocRing

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toNonUnitalCommRing
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → NonUnitalCommRing α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstance
{α : Sort u} → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstance` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This function has the same type signature as the identity
function, but the square brackets on the `[i : α]` argument means that it will
attempt to construct this argument by typeclass inference. (This will fail if
`α` is not a `class`.) Example:
```
#check (inferInstance : Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat

def foo : Inhabited (Nat × Nat) :=
  inferInstance

example : foo.default = (default, default) :=
  rfl
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.instCommRingMvPolynomial
{R : Type u} → {σ : Type u_1} → [inst : CommRing R] → CommRing (MvPolynomial σ R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Or
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Or a b`, or `a ∨ b`, is the disjunction of propositions. There are two
constructors for `Or`, called `Or.inl : a → a ∨ b` and `Or.inr : b → a ∨ b`,
and you can use `match` or `cases` to destruct an `Or` assumption into the
two cases.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∨` in identifiers is `or`.

 * The recommended spelling of `\/` in identifiers is `or` (prefer `∨` over `\/`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd
{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instLEInt
LE ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.decLe
(a b : ℤ) → Decidable (a ≤ b)

Docstring: Decides whether `a ≤ b`.

```
#eval ¬ ( (7 : Int) ≤ (0 : Int) ) -- true

#eval (7 : Int) ≤ (10 : Int) -- true
```

Implemented by efficient native code. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.X

Docstring: `X n` is the degree `1` monomial $X_n$. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.toNat
ℤ → ℕ

Docstring: Converts an integer into a natural number. Negative numbers are converted to `0`.

Examples:
* `(7 : Int).toNat = 7`
* `(0 : Int).toNat = 0`
* `(-7 : Int).toNat = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.nil
{α : Type u} → List α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.lt_of_succ_lt
∀ {n m : ℕ}, n.succ < m → n < m

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite.toFinset
{α : Type u} → {s : Set α} → s.Finite → Finset α

Docstring: Using choice, get the `Finset` that represents this `Set`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.head
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Docstring: Returns the first element of a non-empty list.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.getLast
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Docstring: Returns the last element of a non-empty list.

Examples:
* `["circle", "rectangle"].getLast (by decide) = "rectangle"`
* `["circle"].getLast (by decide) = "circle"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.brecOn
{α : Type u} → {motive : List α → Sort u_1} → (t : List α) → ((t : List α) → List.below t → motive t) → motive t

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.below
{α : Type u} → {motive : List α → Sort u_1} → List α → Sort (max (u + 1) u_1)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.cons
{α : Type u} → α → List α → List α

Docstring: The list whose first element is `head`, where `tail` is the rest of the list.
Usually written `head :: tail`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `::` in identifiers is `cons`.

 * The recommended spelling of `[a]` in identifiers is `singleton`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
thm.sf.lgv-path-weight-sum-eq-hsymm-ext

\leanhelper  The LGV path weight sum from $(a, 1)$ to $(c, N)$ using the Jacobi–Trudi arc weight equals $h_{c-a}$: 

\[  \sum _{p : (a,1) \to (c,N)} w_{\mathrm{LGV}}(p) = h_{c-a}.  \]

 When $c - a \geq 0$, this is proved via a weight-preserving bijection between LGV paths and our lattice path type, composed with Theorem~ \ref{thm.sf.jt-obs1}. When $c - a < 0$, both sides are $0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.lattice
def.lgv.lattice

We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ (so the vertices are pairs of integers) and arcs 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i+1,j\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}  \]

 and 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i,j+1\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}.  \]

 The arcs of the first form are called \emph{east-steps} or \emph{right-steps}; the arcs of the second form are called \emph{north-steps} or \emph{up-steps}. 

The vertices of this digraph will be called \emph{lattice points} or \emph{grid points} or simply \emph{points}. 

The entire digraph will be denoted by $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ and called the \emph{integer lattice} or \emph{integer grid}. 

Any path is uniquely determined by its starting point and its step sequence.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.hsymm-ext
def.sf.hsymm-ext

\leanhelper  The extended $h_n$: $h_n = 0$ for $n < 0$, $h_0 = 1$. This is needed since the Jacobi–Trudi formula may have negative indices.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.jt-arc-weight
def.sf.jt-arc-weight

\leanhelper  The arc weight function for the Jacobi–Trudi proof on the integer lattice $\mathbb {Z}^2$: east-steps at height $y$ (with $1 \leq y \leq N$) are weighted by $x_{y-1}$; north-steps are weighted by $1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The elaborated target adds the hypothesis `0 < N` in `\u2200 {N : \u2115} ... (a c : \u2124), 0 < N \u2192 ...`, while the blueprint states the equality from `(a,1)` to `(c,N)` without assuming `N > 0`. This is a mathematically substantive restriction, not merely encoding: since `N : \u2115`, the omitted case `N = 0` is possible. In that case no north/east path can go from height `1` to height `0`, so the path sum is `0`; but when `c = a`, `hsymmExt (c-a) = h_0 = 1` by the supplied definition. Thus the unrestricted blueprint statement is actually false with these definitions. The difference enters directly through the target binder `0 < N`. To make the formal theorem faithful, the blueprint would need to state `N > 0`; alternatively, the target would need to cover `N = 0`, which cannot hold without changing the endpoint or the supplied definitions."
