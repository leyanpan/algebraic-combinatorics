Docstring: Cell bijection: SchurBasics cell (i, j) ↔ LittlewoodRichardson cell (i, j+1).

SchurBasics: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i ≤ j < λ_i
LittlewoodRichardson: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i < j ≤ λ_i

The map (i, j) ↦ (i, j+1) transforms the first to the second. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => lam.youngDiagram \ mu.youngDiagram

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is the set difference Y(λ) \ Y(μ).
Definition \ref{def.sf.skew-diag} in the source.

**Note**: This is a duplicate of `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` that requires `[NeZero N]`.
Prefer `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` for new code as it works for all `N`.

For N-partitions λ and μ with μ ⊆ λ, the skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is defined as:
```
Y(λ) \ Y(μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ [λ_i] \ [μ_i]}
            = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ ℤ and μ_i < j ≤ λ_i}
```
(The second form uses 1-indexed j as in the textbook.)

In our 0-indexed formalization, this becomes:
```
Y(λ/μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ Fin N and μ_i ≤ j < λ_i}
```

Example: Y((4,3,1)/(2,1,0)) consists of cells:
- Row 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)  (since μ₀ = 2, λ₀ = 4)
- Row 1: (1, 1), (1, 2)  (since μ₁ = 1, λ₁ = 3)
- Row 2: (2, 0)          (since μ₂ = 0, λ₂ = 1) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Set (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => {c | mu c.1 < c.2 ∧ c.2 ≤ lam c.1}

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(lam/mu) as a set of cells.
A cell (i,j) is in Y(lam/mu) if mu_i < j ≤ lam_i.

**This is the `Set` version with 1-indexed columns (textbook convention).**
The first column is j = 1, not j = 0.

For the canonical `Finset` version with 0-indexed columns, see:
- `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` in NPartition.lean (canonical, no `[NeZero N]` required)
- `skewYoungDiagram` in SchurBasics.lean (duplicate, requires `[NeZero N]`)

Comparison:
- Here: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i < j ≤ λ_i (1-indexed)
- NPartition/SchurBasics: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i ≤ j < λ_i (0-indexed)

The bijection between them is: (i, j) here ↔ (i, j-1) in NPartition/SchurBasics.
See `SchurBasics.mem_skewYoungDiagram_iff_mem_LR_shifted` for the conversion lemma. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.youngDiagram (def)

Body:
fun {N} μ => Finset.univ.biUnion fun i => Finset.map { toFun := fun j => (i, j), inj' := ⋯ } (Finset.range (μ.parts i))

Docstring: The Young diagram Y(λ) of an N-partition λ is the set of cells (i, j) where
i ∈ Fin N and j < λ_i.
Definition def.sf.ydiag in the source.

Note: Mathlib has `YoungDiagram` which is more general (infinite diagrams).
Here we define a version specific to N-partitions. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF NeZero
{R : Type u_1} → [Zero R] → R → Prop

Docstring: A type-class version of `n ≠ 0`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv
Sort u_1 → Sort u_2 → Sort (max (max 1 u_1) u_2)

Docstring: `α ≃ β` is the type of functions from `α → β` with a two-sided inverse. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instSubNat

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone

{α : Type u} → [self : SDiff α] → α → α → α

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le

Docstring: `Finset.biUnion s t` is the union of `t a` over `a ∈ s`.

(This was formerly `bind` due to the monad structure on types with `DecidableEq`.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from

(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Embedding.mk
{α : Sort u_1} → {β : Sort u_2} → (toFun : α → β) → Function.Injective toFun → α ↪ β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.skew-cell-equiv

\leanhelper  The \emph{cell bijection} between two representations of skew Young diagrams. The first uses 0-indexed columns ($(i,j) \in Y(\lambda /\mu )$ iff $\mu _i \le j < \lambda _i$), and the second uses 1-indexed columns ($(i,j) \in Y(\lambda /\mu )$ iff $\mu _i < j \le \lambda _i$). The bijection is $(i, j) \mapsto (i, j+1)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv-2eb59533
conv-2eb59533

In the Lean formalization, we use $\operatorname {Fin} n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots , n-1\} $ instead of the textbook’s $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. Both are $n$-element sets, so their symmetric groups are isomorphic. Permutations are represented by the type of bijections $X \to X$ (denoted $\operatorname {Equiv.Perm}\,  X$ in Lean), which is a group under composition. Composition $\alpha \beta $ is the group multiplication $\alpha * \beta $, sending $x$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar-order
def.sf.Npar-order

\leanhelper  We define a partial order on $N$-partitions by componentwise comparison: $\mu \leq \nu $ iff $\mu _i \leq \nu _i$ for all $i \in [N]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar-skewyoungdiagram
def.sf.Npar-skewYoungDiagram

\leanhelper  The \emph{skew Young diagram} $Y(\lambda /\mu )$ for $N$-partitions $\lambda , \mu $ is the set difference $Y(\lambda ) \setminus Y(\mu )$, consisting of cells $(i, j)$ with $\mu _i \leq j < \lambda _i$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar-youngdiagram
def.sf.Npar-youngDiagram

\leanhelper  The \emph{Young diagram} $Y(\lambda )$ of an $N$-partition $\lambda $ is the finite set of cells 

\[  Y(\lambda ) = \{ (i, j) : i \in [N],\;  0 \leq j < \lambda _i\} .  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.par-subset
def.sf.par-subset

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. 

We say that $\mu \subseteq \lambda $ if and only if $Y\left( \mu \right) \subseteq Y\left( \lambda \right) $. Equivalently, $\mu \subseteq \lambda $ if and only if

\[  \text{each }i\in \left[ N\right] \text{ satisfies }\mu _{i}\leq \lambda _{i}.  \]

 Thus we have defined a partial order $\subseteq $ on the set of all $N$-partitions.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-diag
def.sf.skew-diag

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions such that $\mu \subseteq \lambda $. Then, we define the \emph{skew Young diagram} $Y\left( \lambda /\mu \right) $ to be the set difference

\begin{align*}  Y\left( \lambda \right) \setminus Y\left( \mu \right) &  =\left\{  \left( i,j\right) \  \mid \  i\in \left[ N\right] \text{ and }j\in \left[ \lambda _{i}\right] \setminus \left[ \mu _{i}\right] \right\}  \\ &  =\left\{  \left( i,j\right) \  \mid \  i\in \left[ N\right] \text{ and }j\in \mathbb {Z}\text{ and }\mu _{i}<j\leq \lambda _{i}\right\}  . \end{align*}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.ydiag
def.sf.ydiag

Let $\lambda $ be an $N$-partition. 

The \emph{Young diagram} of $\lambda $ is defined as the set

\[  \left\{  \left( i,j\right) \  \mid \  i\in \left[ N\right] \text{ and }j\in \left[ \lambda _{i}\right] \right\}  \subseteq \left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  ^{2}.  \]

 We visually represent each element $\left( i,j\right) $ of this Young diagram as a box in row $i$ and column $j$. 

We denote the Young diagram of $\lambda $ by $Y\left( \lambda \right) $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The bijection itself matches the blueprint exactly: the target maps `\u27e8c, hc\u27e9` to `\u27e8(c.1, c.2 + 1), \u22ef\u27e9`, between the 0-indexed condition `\u03bc_i \u2264 j < \u03bb_i` and the 1-indexed condition `\u03bc_i < j \u2264 \u03bb_i`. However, the elaborated signature adds `[inst : NeZero N]`, restricting the construction to `N \u2260 0`. The informal statement and its definition of an `N`-partition impose no nonzero assumption on `N`; in particular, the supplied convention explicitly uses `Fin n = {0, \u2026, n-1}` without excluding `n = 0`. This restriction enters through the project dependency `skewYoungDiagram`, whose signature itself requires `[NeZero N]`, even though its body is merely `lam.youngDiagram \\ mu.youngDiagram` and the docstring says this requirement is unnecessary. To make the declaration faithful, remove `[NeZero N]` from that dependency and from `skewCellEquiv`, or use the unrestricted Young-diagram difference (equivalently, the canonical unrestricted skew-diagram definition) as the source subtype."
