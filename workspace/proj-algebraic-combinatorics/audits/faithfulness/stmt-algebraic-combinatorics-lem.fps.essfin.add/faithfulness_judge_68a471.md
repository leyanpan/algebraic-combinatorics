Docstring: Sum of two essentially finite families is essentially finite.

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite (def)
{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → {ι : Type u_2} → (ι → R) → Prop

Body:
fun {R} [CommRing R] {ι} f => EssentiallyFinite f

Docstring: A family is essentially finite if its support is finite.
(Definition def.infsum.essfin (a))

**This is an alias** for the canonical `EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin
def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin

\textbf{(a)} A sequence $\left( k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\ldots \right) $ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in \left\{  1,2,3,\ldots \right\}  $ satisfy $k_{i}=0$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} A family $\left( k_{i}\right) _{i\in I}$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $k_{i}=0$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "significant_divergence",
  "discrepancies": [
    {
      "root": "[inst : CommRing R]",
      "severity": "significant",
      "bridge": "The formal theorem can only be instantiated for commutative rings. To recover the blueprint as stated for essentially finite families in an unspecified coefficient setting, one would need a new support argument under suitable additive-zero assumptions (at least enough to ensure `0 + 0 = 0`). This does not follow by instantiating the formal theorem for coefficient types that are not commutative rings; with only arbitrary `Zero` and `Add` structures, the claim can even fail."
    }
  ],
  "justification": "The blueprint says without a coefficient restriction, \u201cThe sum of two essentially finite families is essentially finite,\u201d while its definition describes an arbitrary family `(k_i)_{i\u2208I}` using only the condition `k_i = 0`. The elaborated theorem instead begins `\u2200 {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] ...`, restricting all families to values in a commutative ring. Since neither the informal statement nor its definition fixes that ring setting, the formal theorem does not certify the stated claim across all coefficient settings in which the informal notions of zero and addition can be expressed."
