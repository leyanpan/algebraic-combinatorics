∀ {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] {I : Type u_2} [inst_1 : DecidableEq I] (p : I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) (n : ℕ),

                      (PowerSeries.coeff n) (∑ k ∈ essFinFamilies, ∏ i ∈ In, p i (k i)) =
                        (PowerSeries.coeff n) (∑ f ∈ Fintype.piFinset fun i => S ↑i, ∏ i, p (↑i) (f i))

Docstring: Claim 8: The coefficient of the sum over essentially finite families equals
the coefficient of the sum over the finite index set `I_n`.
`[x^n](∑_{(k_i) ∈ S^I_fin} ∏_{i ∈ I} p_{i,k_i}) = [x^n](∑_{(k_i) ∈ S^{I_n}} ∏_{i ∈ I_n} p_{i,k_i})`.

The proof establishes a bijection between `essFinFamilies` (functions that are 0 outside `In`
and have values in `S i` for `i ∈ In`) and `Fintype.piFinset (fun i : In => S i.1)`.

Note: The hypotheses `hValInS` and `hComplete` ensure that `essFinFamilies` is exactly
the set of extensions of functions in the piFinset. These are needed to establish the
bijection between the two index sets.

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.IndexSetIn (def)
{K : Type u_1} → [CommRing K] → {I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) → ℕ → Set I

Body:
fun {K} [CommRing K] {I} p n => {i | ∃ k, (i, k) ∈ PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSetUnion p n}

Docstring: The index set `I_n` of first components appearing in `T'_n`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} f => EssentiallyFinite f

Docstring: A family `f : I → ℕ` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are 0.
This corresponds to `S^I_fin` in the source.

**This is an alias** for the canonical `_root_.EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`.

This version is specialized to `ℕ` for use in product rule proofs. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSetUnion (def)
{K : Type u_1} → [CommRing K] → {I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) → ℕ → Set (I × ℕ)

Body:
fun {K} [CommRing K] {I} p n => ⋃ m ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSet p m

Docstring: The union of coefficient support sets up to degree n.
This corresponds to `T'_n = T_0 ∪ T_1 ∪ ... ∪ T_n`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSet (def)
{K : Type u_1} → [CommRing K] → {I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) → ℕ → Set (I × ℕ)

Body:
fun {K} [CommRing K] {I} p m => {ik | ik.2 ≠ 0 ∧ (PowerSeries.coeff m) (p ik.1 ik.2) ≠ 0}

Docstring: For a summable family `(p_{i,k})`, the set `T_m` of pairs `(i,k)` with nonzero
`[x^m] p_{i,k}` is finite. This corresponds to equation (pf.prop.fps.prodrule-fin-inf.Tm-def).
(label: pf.prop.fps.prodrule-fin-inf.Tm-def) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF One.toOfNat1

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPowerSeries.instOne
{σ : Type u_1} → {R : Type u_2} → [Semiring R] → One (MvPowerSeries σ R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommSemiring.toSemiring
{R : Type u} → [self : CommSemiring R] → Semiring R

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommSemiring
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → CommSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LinearMap

  {S : Type u_15} →
    [inst : Semiring R] →
      [inst_1 : Semiring S] →

                [inst_3 : AddCommMonoid M₂] → [_root_.Module R M] → [_root_.Module S M₂] → Type (max u_16 u_17)

Docstring: A map `f` between an `R`-module and an `S`-module over a ring homomorphism `σ : R →+* S`
is semilinear if it satisfies the two properties `f (x + y) = f x + f y` and
`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF RingHom.id
(α : Type u_5) → [inst : NonAssocSemiring α] → α →+* α

Docstring: The identity ring homomorphism from a semiring to itself.

  {A : Type u_2} →
    [inst : Semiring R] → [inst_1 : AddCommMonoid A] → [_root_.Module R A] → _root_.Module R (PowerSeries A)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Semiring.toModule

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.coeff
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : Semiring R] → ℕ → PowerSeries R →ₗ[R] R

Docstring: The `n`th coefficient of a formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF NonUnitalNonAssocRing.toNonUnitalNonAssocSemiring
{α : Type u} → [self : NonUnitalNonAssocRing α] → NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF NonUnitalNonAssocCommRing.toNonUnitalNonAssocRing

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toNonUnitalCommRing
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → NonUnitalCommRing α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommMonoid
{α : Type u} → [self : CommRing α] → CommMonoid α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.instCommRing
{R : Type u_1} → [CommRing R] → CommRing (PowerSeries R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SetLike.instMembership
{A : Type u_1} → {B : Type u_2} → [i : SetLike A B] → Membership B A

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSetLike
{α : Type u_1} → SetLike (Finset α) α

Docstring: Convert a finset to a set in the natural way. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.piFinset
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → [Fintype α] → {δ : α → Type u_4} → ((a : α) → Finset (δ a)) → Finset ((a : α) → δ a)

Docstring: Given for all `a : α` a finset `t a` of `δ a`, then one can define the
finset `Fintype.piFinset t` of all functions taking values in `t a` for all `a`. This is the
analogue of `Finset.pi` where the base finset is `univ` (but formally they are not the same, as
there is an additional condition `i ∈ Finset.univ` in the `Finset.pi` definition). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.instDecidableEq
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → [DecidableEq α] → DecidableEq { x // p x }

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.Subtype.fintype
{α : Type u_1} → (s : Finset α) → Fintype { x // x ∈ s }

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.iUnion
{α : Type u} → {ι : Sort v} → (ι → Set α) → Set α

Docstring: Indexed union of a family of sets 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range
ℕ → Finset ℕ

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A type with a zero element. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.support
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (ι → M) → Set ι

Docstring: `support` of a function is the set of points `x` such that `f x ≠ 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero.toOfNat0

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.infprod.claim8

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Claim 8.)} The coefficient of the sum over essentially finite families equals the coefficient of the sum restricted to the finite index set $I_n$: 

\[  [x^n]\Bigl(\sum _{\substack {(k_i) \in S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}}} \prod _{i \in I_n} p_{i,k_i}\Bigr) = [x^n]\Bigl(\sum _{(k_i) \in S^{I_n}} \prod _{i \in I_n} p_{i,k_i}\Bigr).  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.essfinsum

\leanhelper  For an essentially finite family $(a_i)_{i\in I}$, the \emph{essentially finite sum} $\sum _{i\in I} a_i$ is defined as $\sum _{i\in S} a_i$ where $S = \{ i\in I \mid a_i \neq 0\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

\leanhelper  A family $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ of natural numbers is \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many entries equal $0$, i.e., the set $\{ i \in I : k_i \neq 0\} $ is finite. This corresponds to $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ in the source.

\leanhelper  Given a finite subset $I_n \subseteq I$ and a function $f : I_n \to \mathbb {N}$, \emph{extend from finset} produces a function $I \to \mathbb {N}$ by setting $f(i)$ for $i \in I_n$ and $0$ otherwise. This is used in the bijection between essentially finite families supported on $I_n$ and functions $I_n \to S$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.indexsetin
def.fps.infprod.indexSetIn

\leanhelper  The \emph{index set} $I_n$ is the set of first components appearing in $T'_n$: $I_n = \{ i \in I : \exists k,\;  (i,k) \in T'_n\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.restricttofinset
def.fps.infprod.restrictToFinset

\leanhelper  Given a finite subset $I_n \subseteq I$ and a function $k : I \to \mathbb {N}$, \emph{restrict to finset} produces the restriction $k|_{I_n} : I_n \to \mathbb {N}$. This is the inverse direction of the bijection used in Claim~ 8.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.sfini
def.fps.infprod.SfinI

\leanhelper  The set $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ of \emph{essentially finite families} in $\prod _{i \in I} S_i$ is the set of all families $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ such that $k_i \in S_i$ for all $i$ and the family $(k_i)$ is essentially finite.

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The Lean theorem is conditional on mathematically substantive assumptions absent from the blueprint: `(\u2200 (i : I), p i 0 = 1)` and `(\u2200 (i : I), 0 \u2208 S i)`. Thus it proves the claimed equality only for normalized families `p` and sets `S_i` containing zero, whereas the INFORMAL STATEMENT states the equality without these hypotheses. The explicit `essFinFamilies` hypotheses are largely an encoding of the domain `S^I_fin`, but the zero-membership condition is not part of the informal definition of `S^I_fin`; that definition only requires `k_i \u2208 S_i` and finite support. There is also an index mismatch: the blueprint uses exactly `I_n` in both products, while the target binds an arbitrary `In : Finset I` and assumes only `(\u2200 i \u2209 In, i \u2209 PowerSeries.IndexSetIn p n)`, i.e. `IndexSetIn p n \u2286 In`, not that `In = I_n`. Although the exact choice could be a special case if a finset representing `I_n` is available, that finiteness/representation is not supplied by the declaration. To be faithful, the target should bind a finset representing precisely `PowerSeries.IndexSetIn p n` via `\u2200 i, i \u2208 In \u2194 i \u2208 PowerSeries.IndexSetIn p n`, and remove `p i 0 = 1` and `0 \u2208 S i` unless those assumptions are added to the blueprint statement. Alternatively, the informal statement must explicitly carry those hypotheses."
