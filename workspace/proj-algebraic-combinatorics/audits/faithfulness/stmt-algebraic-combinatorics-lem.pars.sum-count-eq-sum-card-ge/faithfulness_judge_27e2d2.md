## TARGET Nat.Partition.sum_count_eq_sum_card_ge (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (n : ℕ) (s : Finset n.Partition) (d : ℕ),
  ∑ p ∈ s, Multiset.count d p.parts = ∑ j ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), {p ∈ s | Multiset.count d p.parts ≥ j + 1}.card

Docstring: The count sum identity: ∑_p count(d, p) = ∑_{j=1}^{max_count} |{p : count(d,p) ≥ j}|.
This is the standard identity that sum of values equals sum of "at least j" counts.

The proof uses double counting: each partition p with count(d,p) = c contributes
c to the LHS and is counted in exactly c of the sets {p : count(d,p) ≥ j+1} for j < c. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition
ℕ → Type

Docstring: A partition of `n` is a multiset of positive integers summing to `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instAddCommMonoid
AddCommMonoid ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Multiset.count
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → α → Multiset α → ℕ

Docstring: `count a s` is the multiplicity of `a` in `s`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.Partition.parts
{n : ℕ} → n.Partition → Multiset ℕ

Docstring: positive integers summing to `n` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range
ℕ → Finset ℕ

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.pars.sum-count-eq-sum-card-ge

\leanhelper  For any finite set $s$ of partitions of $n$ and any $d\in \mathbb {N}$: 

\[  \sum _{p\in s} \operatorname {count}(d, p) = \sum _{j=1}^{n} |\{ p\in s : \operatorname {count}(d,p)\ge j\} |.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npartitionsofsize
def.sf.NPartitionsOfSize

\leanhelper  The finite set of $N$-partitions of size $n$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint\u2019s definitions make a partition an \u201cN-tuple \u2026 of nonnegative integers\u201d of fixed length N and size n, whereas the target binds `(s : Finset n.Partition)`. By the base-library definition, `Nat.Partition n` consists of multisets of positive integers summing to n; it has no N parameter and omits the padded zero entries. Consequently, `Multiset.count d p.parts` is not the blueprint\u2019s count among all N tuple entries, especially for `d = 0`, which the blueprint permits through \u201cany d \u2208 \u2115\u201d. For example, zeros in an N-partition contribute to the informal count but can never occur in `p.parts`. The target also sums over `Finset.range (n + 1)` with threshold `j + 1`, hence thresholds 1 through n+1, while the blueprint explicitly sums from 1 through n. The extra term is harmless for `Nat.Partition` because its positive parts have multiplicity at most n, but it is not generally harmless for counts of zero entries in an N-tuple. To be faithful, the declaration must bind N, take `s` to be a finite set of weakly decreasing N-tuples of nonnegative integers of size n, count d among all N entries, and use thresholds 1 through n (e.g. `j \u2208 Finset.range n` with threshold `j + 1`). Notably, with the supplied blueprint definitions the stated identity is itself false for unrestricted `d = 0` (for instance an all-zero tuple when n = 0), but it is still a statable proposition; the present declaration states a different, true identity for ordinary positive-part partitions."
