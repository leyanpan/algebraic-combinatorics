## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewSchurPoly_isSymmetric (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] {N : ℕ} (lam mu : Fin N → ℕ),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition lam →
    AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition mu → (AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewSchurPoly lam mu).IsSymmetric

Docstring: The skew Schur polynomial is symmetric when lam and mu are N-partitions.

This follows from Bender-Knuth involutions: for each adjacent transposition (k, k+1),
the Bender-Knuth involution BK_k gives a bijection on semistandard tableaux
that swaps the content entries k and k+1. Since adjacent transpositions generate
the symmetric group, this proves skewSchurPoly is invariant under all permutations.

The partition hypotheses are required for `benderKnuth_involutive_partition`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {N} lam => IsNPartition lam

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of natural numbers.
(Used throughout the source)

This is an alias for the canonical definition in `NPartition.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewSchurPoly (def)
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : CommRing R] → {N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → MvPolynomial (Fin N) R

Body:
fun {R} [CommRing R] {N} lam mu => ∑ T, AlgebraicCombinatorics.xPow (AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentTableau ↑T)

Docstring: The skew Schur polynomial s_{lam/mu}.
Defined as a sum over semistandard tableaux of shape lam/mu:
s_{lam/mu} = ∑_{T semistandard of shape lam/mu} x^(cont(T))

Note: This is a finite sum since there are finitely many semistandard tableaux
of any given shape (entries are bounded by N).

## Relationship to Other Definitions

This project has two skew Schur polynomial definitions with different design tradeoffs:

| Definition | File | Input | Ring | Use case |
|------------|------|-------|------|----------|
| `AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewSchurPoly` (this) | LittlewoodRichardson.lean | `Fin N → ℕ` | generic `R` | Littlewood-Richardson rule, generic rings |
| `skewSchurPoly` | SchurBasics.lean | `NPartition N` | `ℤ` | Proofs using skew diagrams, symmetry |

**When to use which:**
- Use **this definition** when you need a generic coefficient ring `R`, when working
  with the Littlewood-Richardson rule, or when you have an unbundled `Fin N → ℕ`.
- Use **`SchurBasics.skewSchurPoly`** when working with skew Young diagrams, SSYT
  fillings as explicit structures, or proving symmetry properties. It requires
  `[NeZero N]` and uses integer coefficients.

**Equivalence:** See `SSYTEquiv.lean` for the bridge between these definitions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY IsNPartition (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {N} lam => ∀ (i j : Fin N), i ≤ j → lam j ≤ lam i

Docstring: An N-partition predicate: an N-tuple is an N-partition if it is weakly decreasing.
This is equivalent to `Antitone` for functions `Fin N → ℕ`.
(Used throughout the source) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Type

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => { c // c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram lam mu } → Fin N

Docstring: A tableau of shape lam/mu is a function from cells to [N]. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsSemistandard (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → Prop

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} T =>
  (∀ (c₁ c₂ : { c // c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram lam mu }),
      (↑c₁).1 = (↑c₂).1 → (↑c₁).2 < (↑c₂).2 → T c₁ ≤ T c₂) ∧
    ∀ (c₁ c₂ : { c // c ∈ AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram lam mu }),
      (↑c₁).2 = (↑c₂).2 → (↑c₁).1 < (↑c₂).1 → T c₁ < T c₂

Docstring: A tableau is semistandard if entries weakly increase along rows
and strictly increase down columns. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.semistandardTableau_fintype (def)
{N : ℕ} → (lam mu : Fin N → ℕ) → Fintype { T // AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsSemistandard T }

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => Fintype.subtype (Finset.filter AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsSemistandard Finset.univ) ⋯

Docstring: The type of semistandard tableaux of a given shape is finite.
This follows from the fact that entries are bounded by N and the shape is finite. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.xPow (def)
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : CommRing R] → {N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → MvPolynomial (Fin N) R

Body:
fun {R} [CommRing R] {N} α => AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.monomialExp α

Docstring: x^α = ∏ᵢ xᵢ^(αᵢ) for an N-tuple α.

This is an alias for `AlgebraicCombinatorics.SymmetricFunctions.monomialExp` from MonomialSymmetric.lean.
The two definitions are identical: both equal `∏ i, X i ^ α i`.

See also: `xPow_eq_monomialExp` for the equivalence lemma. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.contentTableau (def)
{N : ℕ} → {lam mu : Fin N → ℕ} → AlgebraicCombinatorics.Tableau lam mu → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} {lam mu} T i => Nat.card { c // T c = i }

Docstring: **Definition (def.sf.content)**: The content of a tableau T is the N-tuple counting
occurrences of each value.

For a tableau T of shape λ/μ, we define the content of T to be the N-tuple
(a₁, a₂, ..., a_N), where aᵢ = (# of i's in T) = (# of boxes c of T such that T(c) = i).

We denote this N-tuple by cont(T).

**Example**: If N=5, then cont([[1,1,2],[4]]) = (2,1,0,1,0).

**Key property** (eq.def.sf.content.xT=): x_T = x^(cont(T)) for any tableau T.
(Both sides equal ∏ᵢ xᵢ^(# of i's in T).) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → (Fin N → ℕ) → (Fin N → ℕ) → Set (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} lam mu => {c | mu c.1 < c.2 ∧ c.2 ≤ lam c.1}

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(lam/mu) as a set of cells.
A cell (i,j) is in Y(lam/mu) if mu_i < j ≤ lam_i.

**This is the `Set` version with 1-indexed columns (textbook convention).**
The first column is j = 1, not j = 0.

For the canonical `Finset` version with 0-indexed columns, see:
- `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` in NPartition.lean (canonical, no `[NeZero N]` required)
- `skewYoungDiagram` in SchurBasics.lean (duplicate, requires `[NeZero N]`)

Comparison:
- Here: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i < j ≤ λ_i (1-indexed)
- NPartition/SchurBasics: (i, j) ∈ Y(λ/μ) iff μ_i ≤ j < λ_i (0-indexed)

The bijection between them is: (i, j) here ↔ (i, j-1) in NPartition/SchurBasics.
See `SchurBasics.mem_skewYoungDiagram_iff_mem_LR_shifted` for the conversion lemma.

This follows from the fact that entries are in Fin N and the shape is finite.

(Definition def.sf.sort (a))

Docstring: The skew Young diagram is finite. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.IsSymmetric
{σ : Type u_1} → {R : Type u_3} → [inst : CommSemiring R] → MvPolynomial σ R → Prop

Docstring: A `MvPolynomial φ` is symmetric if it is invariant under
permutations of its variables by the `rename` operation 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommSemiring
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → CommSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.val
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → Subtype p → α

Docstring: The value in the underlying type that satisfies the predicate.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-equal relation: `x ≤ y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≤` in identifiers is `le`.

 * The recommended spelling of `<=` in identifiers is `le` (prefer `≤` over `<=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLEFin
{n : ℕ} → LE (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTFin
{n : ℕ} → LT (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fintype.subtype
{α : Type u_1} → {p : α → Prop} → (s : Finset α) → (∀ (x : α), x ∈ s ↔ p x) → Fintype { x // p x }

Docstring: Given a predicate that can be represented by a finset, the subtype
associated to the predicate is a fintype. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.card
Type u_3 → ℕ

Docstring: `Nat.card α` is the cardinality of `α` as a natural number.
If `α` is infinite, `Nat.card α = 0`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable
Prop → Type

Docstring: Either a proof that `p` is true or a proof that `p` is false. This is equivalent to a `Bool` paired
with a proof that the `Bool` is `true` if and only if `p` is true.

`Decidable` instances are primarily used via `if`-expressions and the tactic `decide`. In
conditional expressions, the `Decidable` instance for the proposition is used to select a branch. At
run time, this case distinction code is identical to that which would be generated for a
`Bool`-based conditional. In proofs, the tactic `decide` synthesizes an instance of `Decidable p`,
attempts to reduce it to `isTrue h`, and then succeeds with the proof `h` if it can.

Because `Decidable` carries data, when writing `@[simp]` lemmas which include a `Decidable` instance
on the LHS, it is best to use `{_ : Decidable p}` rather than `[Decidable p]` so that non-canonical
instances can be found via unification rather than instance synthesis.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF id
{α : Sort u} → α → α

Docstring: The identity function. `id` takes an implicit argument `α : Sort u`
(a type in any universe), and an argument `a : α`, and returns `a`.

Although this may look like a useless function, one application of the identity
function is to explicitly put a type on an expression. If `e` has type `T`,
and `T'` is definitionally equal to `T`, then `@id T' e` typechecks, and Lean
knows that this expression has type `T'` rather than `T`. This can make a
difference for typeclass inference, since `T` and `T'` may have different
typeclass instances on them. `show T' from e` is sugar for an `@id T' e`
expression.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstance
{α : Sort u} → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstance` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This function has the same type signature as the identity
function, but the square brackets on the `[i : α]` argument means that it will
attempt to construct this argument by typeclass inference. (This will fail if
`α` is not a `class`.) Example:
```
#check (inferInstance : Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat

def foo : Inhabited (Nat × Nat) :=
  inferInstance

example : foo.default = (default, default) :=
  rfl
```

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Skew Schur polynomial is symmetric

\leanhelper  For $N$-partitions $\lambda $ and $\mu $, the skew Schur polynomial $s_{\lambda /\mu } \in \mathcal{P}$ is symmetric (invariant under all permutations of the variables).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.npar
def.sf.Npar

An $N$\emph{-partition} will mean a weakly decreasing $N$-tuple of nonnegative integers. In other words, an $N$-partition means an $N$-tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{N}\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{N}$ with $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{N}$. 

The \emph{size} (or weight) of an $N$-partition $\lambda = (\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _N)$ is defined to be $|\lambda | := \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 + \cdots + \lambda _N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.skew-schur
def.sf.skew-schur

Let $\lambda $ and $\mu $ be two $N$-partitions. We define the \emph{skew Schur polynomial} $s_{\lambda /\mu }\in \mathcal{P}$ by

\[  s_{\lambda /\mu }:=\sum _{T\in \operatorname *{SSYT}\left( \lambda /\mu \right) }x_{T}.  \]

  "justification": "The target quantifies over `lam mu : Fin N \u2192 \u2115` and assumes `AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition lam` and `AlgebraicCombinatorics.IsNPartition mu`, matching \u201cFor N-partitions \u03bb and \u03bc.\u201d The predicate unfolds to `\u2200 i j, i \u2264 j \u2192 lam j \u2264 lam i`, exactly the blueprint\u2019s weakly decreasing N-tuples of nonnegative integers. Its conclusion `(AlgebraicCombinatorics.skewSchurPoly lam mu).IsSymmetric` matches \u201cthe skew Schur polynomial \u2026 is symmetric (invariant under all permutations of the variables),\u201d since `MvPolynomial.IsSymmetric` is documented as invariance under variable permutations. The polynomial definition is the sum over semistandard tableaux of `xPow (contentTableau T)`, matching `\u2211_{T\u2208SSYT(\u03bb/\u03bc)} x_T`. The binder `{R} [CommRing R]` makes the result more general in coefficients than the unspecified polynomial ring `\ud835\udcab`; it does not weaken the stated claim."
