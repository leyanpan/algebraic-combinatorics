## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Matrix
Type u → Type u' → Type v → Type (max u u' v)

Docstring: `Matrix m n R` is the type of matrices with entries in `R`, whose rows are indexed by `m`
and whose columns are indexed by `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Docstring: Given maps `(r : l → m)` and `(c : o → n)` reindexing the rows and columns of
a matrix `M : Matrix m n α`, the matrix `M.submatrix r c : Matrix l o α` is defined
by `(M.submatrix r c) i j = M (r i) (c j)` for `(i,j) : l × o`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.orderEmbOfFin

Docstring: Given a finset `s` of cardinality `k` in a linear order `α`, the map `orderEmbOfFin s h` is
the increasing bijection between `Fin k` and `s` as an order embedding into `α`. Here, `h` is a
proof that the cardinality of `s` is `k`. We use this instead of an embedding `Fin s.card ↪o α` to
avoid casting issues in further uses of this function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF rfl
∀ {α : Sort u} {a : α}, a = a

Docstring: `rfl : a = a` is the unique constructor of the equality type. This is the
same as `Eq.refl` except that it takes `a` implicitly instead of explicitly.

This is a more powerful theorem than it may appear at first, because although
the statement of the theorem is `a = a`, Lean will allow anything that is
definitionally equal to that type. So, for instance, `2 + 2 = 4` is proven in
Lean by `rfl`, because both sides are the same up to definitional equality.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.det.charpol-explicit

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $A\in K^{n\times n}$ be an $n\times n$-matrix. Let $x\in K$. Let $I_n$ denote the $n\times n$ identity matrix. Then, 

\[  \det (A + x I_n) = \sum _{P\subseteq [n]} \det (\operatorname {sub}_P^P A) \cdot x^{n-|P|} = \sum _{k=0}^{n} \biggl(\sum _{\substack {P\subseteq [n];\\ |P|=n-k}} \det (\operatorname {sub}_P^P A)\biggr) x^k.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.det
def.det.det

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. Let $A \in K^{n \times n}$ be an $n \times n$-matrix. The \emph{determinant} $\det A$ of $A$ is defined to be the element 

\[  \sum _{\sigma \in S_n} (-1)^{\sigma } \underbrace{A_{1,\sigma (1)} A_{2,\sigma (2)} \cdots A_{n,\sigma (n)}}_{ = \prod _{i=1}^{n} A_{i,\sigma (i)}}  \]

 of $K$. Here: 

\begin{itemize} \item we let $S_n$ denote the $n$-th symmetric group (i.e., the group of permutations of $[n] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $); 

\item we let $(-1)^{\sigma }$ denote the sign of the permutation $\sigma $ (as defined in Definition~ \ref{def.perm.sign}). 

\end{itemize}

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.det.sub
def.det.sub

Let $n,m\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $A$ be an $n\times m$-matrix. 

Let $U$ be a subset of $[n]$. Let $V$ be a subset of $[m]$. 

Writing the two sets $U$ and $V$ as 

\[  U=\{ u_1,u_2,\ldots ,u_p\}  \quad \text{and}\quad V=\{ v_1,v_2,\ldots ,v_q\}   \]

 with 

\[  u_1<u_2<\cdots <u_p \quad \text{and}\quad v_1<v_2<\cdots <v_q,  \]

 we set 

\[  \operatorname {sub}_U^V A:=\left(A_{u_i,v_j}\right)_{1\le i\le p,\  1\le j\le q}.  \]

Roughly speaking, $\operatorname {sub}_U^V A$ is the matrix obtained from $A$ by focusing only on the $i$-th rows for $i\in U$ (that is, removing all the other rows) and only on the $j$-th columns for $j\in V$ (that is, removing all the other columns). 

This matrix $\operatorname {sub}_U^V A$ is called the \emph{submatrix of} $A$ \emph{obtained by restricting to the $U$-rows and the $V$-columns}. If this matrix is square (i.e., if $|U|=|V|$), then its determinant $\det (\operatorname {sub}_U^V A)$ is called a \emph{minor} of $A$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.invs
def.perm.invs

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $\sigma \in S_{n}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{inversion} of $\sigma $ means a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ of elements of $\left[n\right]$ such that $i<j$ and $\sigma \left(i\right) >\sigma \left(j\right)$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{length} (also known as the \emph{Coxeter length}) of $\sigma $ is the \#  of inversions of $\sigma $. It is called $\ell \left( \sigma \right)$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sign
def.perm.sign

Let $n \in \mathbb {N}$. The \emph{sign} of a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is defined to be the integer $(-1)^{\ell (\sigma )}$. 

It is denoted by $(-1)^{\sigma }$ or $\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )$ or $\operatorname {sign}(\sigma )$ or $\varepsilon (\sigma )$. It is also known as the \emph{signature} of $\sigma $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.sn-iven
def.perm.Sn-iven

Let $n \in \mathbb {Z}$. Then, $[n]$ shall mean the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $. This is an $n$-element set if $n \ge 0$, and is an empty set if $n \le 0$. 

The symmetric group $S_{[n]}$ (consisting of all permutations of $[n]$) will be denoted $S_n$ and called the $n$\emph{-th symmetric group}. Its size is $n!$ (when $n \ge 0$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "Both Lean declarations add the mathematically substantive binder `\u2200 {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R]`, whereas the blueprint only says \u201cLet A \u2208 K^{n\u00d7n}\u201d and \u201cLet x \u2208 K\u201d and nowhere in the supplied statement or definitions assumes that `K` is a commutative ring. Under the package rules, that missing ambient assumption cannot be supplied implicitly, so `[CommRing R]` restricts the quantified coefficient domains and makes the formal theorems weaker. This restriction enters through both targets and through the dependency `Matrix.det`, whose signature itself requires `[CommRing R]`. Apart from this, the two displayed Lean equalities correctly encode the two sums: all `P : Finset (Fin n)` represent subsets of `[n]`, and `Finset.range (n + 1)` represents `k = 0,\u2026,n`. To make the formalization faithful, the blueprint would need to state that `K` is a commutative ring; alternatively, `Matrix.det` and the targets would need definitions and binders valid for whatever weaker coefficient structure the blueprint actually intends."
