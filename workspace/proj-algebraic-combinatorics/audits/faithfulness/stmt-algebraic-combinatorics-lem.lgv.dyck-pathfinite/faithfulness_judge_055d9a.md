## TARGET LGV.dyckDigraph_pathFinite (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
LGV.dyckDigraph.IsPathFinite

Docstring: The Dyck digraph is path-finite.

**Proof:** We show that paths from u to v are finite by:
1. If v.1 < u.1, no paths exist (x-coordinate strictly increases along arcs)
2. Otherwise, paths have fixed length n = v.1 - u.1 + 1
3. The y-coordinate is bounded: 0 ≤ y ≤ u.2 + n at each vertex
4. Each path is determined by its vertex sequence, which is a function Fin n → box
5. Since box is finite and n is finite, there are finitely many such functions
6. The map from paths to vertex sequences is injective, so paths are finite

Docstring: The Dyck path digraph: vertices are ℤ × ℕ, arcs go (i,j) → (i+1, j+1) and (i,j) → (i+1, j-1).
Used for counting Catalan numbers via Dyck paths.

A Dyck path from (0,0) to (2n,0) corresponds to a balanced sequence of n up-steps
and n down-steps that never goes below the x-axis. A Dyck path is a lattice path
that stays on or above the x-axis, where each step goes either up-right or down-right.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Body:
fun {α} s => Finite ↑s

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst

Body:
fun α β self => self.1

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Add

Body:
fun α [self : Add α] => self.1

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`. See `HAdd`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

Body:
{ add := Int.add }

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.add
ℤ → ℤ → ℤ

Body:
fun m n =>
  match m, n with
  | Int.ofNat m, Int.ofNat n => Int.ofNat (m + n)
  | Int.ofNat m, Int.negSucc n => Int.subNatNat m n.succ
  | Int.negSucc m, Int.ofNat n => Int.subNatNat n m.succ
  | Int.negSucc m, Int.negSucc n => Int.negSucc (m + n).succ

Docstring: Addition of integers, usually accessed via the `+` operator.

This function is overridden by the compiler with an efficient implementation. This definition is
the logical model.

Examples:
 * `(7 : Int) + (6 : Int) = 13`
 * `(6 : Int) + (-6 : Int) = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.ofNat
ℕ → ℤ

Docstring: A natural number is an integer.

This constructor covers the non-negative integers (from `0` to `∞`).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Body:
fun α β self => self.2

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.add
ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

Body:
fun x x_1 =>
  Nat.brecOn (motive := fun x => ℕ → ℕ) x_1
    (fun x f x_2 =>
      (match (motive := ℕ → (x : ℕ) → Nat.below (motive := fun x => ℕ → ℕ) x → ℕ) x_2, x with
        | a, Nat.zero => fun x => a
        | a, b.succ => fun x => (x.1 a).succ)
        f)
    x

Docstring: Addition of natural numbers, typically used via the `+` operator.

This function is overridden in both the kernel and the compiler to efficiently evaluate using the
arbitrary-precision arithmetic library. The definition provided here is the logical model.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.lt
ℕ → ℕ → Prop

Body:
fun n m => n.succ.le m

Docstring: Strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the `<` operator.

It is defined as `n < m = n + 1 ≤ m`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.nil
{α : Type u} → List α

Docstring: The empty list, usually written `[]`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `[]` in identifiers is `nil`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Body:
fun {α} x =>
  List.brecOn x fun x f =>
    (match (motive := (x : List α) → List.below x → ℕ) x with
      | [] => fun x => 0
      | head :: as => fun x => x.1 + 1)
      f

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.lt_of_succ_lt
∀ {n m : ℕ}, n.succ < m → n < m

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.head
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Body:
fun {α} x x_1 =>
  match x, x_1 with
  | a :: tail, x => a

Docstring: Returns the first element of a non-empty list.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.getLast
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Docstring: Returns the last element of a non-empty list.

Examples:
* `["circle", "rectangle"].getLast (by decide) = "rectangle"`
* `["circle"].getLast (by decide) = "circle"`


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Dyck digraph is path-finite

\leanhelper  The Dyck digraph is path-finite.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.catalan.dyck
def.catalan.dyck

\leanhelper  A \emph{Dyck word} of length $2n$ is a list of $0$s and $1$s with equal numbers of each, such that every prefix has at least as many $1$s as $0$s.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.lattice
def.lgv.lattice

We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ (so the vertices are pairs of integers) and arcs 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i+1,j\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}  \]

 and 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i,j+1\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}.  \]

 The arcs of the first form are called \emph{east-steps} or \emph{right-steps}; the arcs of the second form are called \emph{north-steps} or \emph{up-steps}. 

The vertices of this digraph will be called \emph{lattice points} or \emph{grid points} or simply \emph{points}. 

The entire digraph will be denoted by $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ and called the \emph{integer lattice} or \emph{integer grid}. 

Any path is uniquely determined by its starting point and its step sequence.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "unclear",
  "discrepancies": [],
  "justification": "The target unfolds to path-finiteness of the specific graph on `\u2124 \u00d7 \u2115` whose arcs are diagonal up/down steps: `v.1 = u.1 + 1 \u2227 v.2 = u.2 + 1 \u2228 ... v.2 + 1 = u.2 \u2227 0 < u.2`. The blueprint only says \u201cDyck digraph is path-finite\u201d but supplies no definition of \u201cDyck digraph.\u201d Its Dyck definition instead defines a \u201cDyck word,\u201d while `def.lgv.lattice` defines a different graph on `\u2124\u00b2` with east and north steps. Thus the package does not determine whether the graph formalized by `LGV.dyckDigraph` is the graph intended by the informal statement. A blueprint definition of the Dyck digraph, or an explicit identification of it with the formal graph, is needed."
