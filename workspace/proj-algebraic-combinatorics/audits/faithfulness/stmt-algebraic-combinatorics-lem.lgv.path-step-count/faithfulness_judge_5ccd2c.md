## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instNatCastInt
NatCast ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHSub
{α : Type u_1} → [Sub α] → HSub α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instSub
Sub ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.count
{α : Type u} → [BEq α] → α → List α → ℕ

Docstring: Counts the number of times an element occurs in a list.

Examples:
* `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5].count 1 = 2`
* `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5].count 5 = 1`
* `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5].count 4 = 0`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instBEqOfDecidableEq
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → BEq α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.foldl
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → (α → β → α) → α → List β → α

Docstring: Folds a function over a list from the left, accumulating a value starting with `init`. The
accumulated value is combined with the each element of the list in order, using `f`.

Examples:
 * `[a, b, c].foldl f z  = f (f (f z a) b) c`
 * `[1, 2, 3].foldl (· ++ toString ·) "" = "123"`
 * `[1, 2, 3].foldl (s!"({·} {·})") "" = "((( 1) 2) 3)"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable
Prop → Type

Docstring: Either a proof that `p` is true or a proof that `p` is false. This is equivalent to a `Bool` paired
with a proof that the `Bool` is `true` if and only if `p` is true.

`Decidable` instances are primarily used via `if`-expressions and the tactic `decide`. In
conditional expressions, the `Decidable` instance for the proposition is used to select a branch. At
run time, this case distinction code is identical to that which would be generated for a
`Bool`-based conditional. In proofs, the tactic `decide` synthesizes an instance of `Decidable p`,
attempts to reduce it to `isTrue h`, and then succeeds with the proof `h` if it can.

Because `Decidable` carries data, when writing `@[simp]` lemmas which include a `Decidable` instance
on the LHS, it is best to use `{_ : Decidable p}` rather than `[Decidable p]` so that non-canonical
instances can be found via unification rather than instance synthesis.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable.isTrue
{p : Prop} → p → Decidable p

Docstring: Proves that `p` is decidable by supplying a proof of `p` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Decidable.isFalse
{p : Prop} → ¬p → Decidable p

Docstring: Proves that `p` is decidable by supplying a proof of `¬p` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format
Type

Docstring: A representation of a set of strings, in which the placement of newlines and indentation differ.

Given a specific line width, specified in columns, the string that uses the fewest lines can be
selected.

The pretty-printing algorithm is based on Wadler's paper
[_A Prettier Printer_](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Repr.addAppParen
Format → ℕ → Format

Docstring: Adds parentheses to `f` if the precedence `prec` from the context is at least that of function
application.

Together with `reprArg`, this can be used to correctly parenthesize function application
syntax.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.group
Format → optParam Std.Format.FlattenBehavior Std.Format.FlattenBehavior.allOrNone → Format

Docstring: Creates a new flattening group for the given inner `Format`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.nest
ℤ → Format → Format

Docstring: `nest indent f` increases the current indentation level by `indent` while rendering `f`.

Example:
```lean example
open Std Format in
def fmtList (l : List Format) : Format :=
  let f := joinSep l  (", " ++ Format.line)
  group (nest 1 <| "[" ++ f ++ "]")
```

This will be written all on one line, but if the text is too large, the formatter will put in
linebreaks after the commas and indent later lines by 1.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge
{α : Type u} → [LE α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.decLe
(n m : ℕ) → Decidable (n ≤ m)

Docstring: A decision procedure for non-strict inequality of natural numbers, usually accessed via the
`DecidableLE Nat` instance.

Examples:
 * `(if 3 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "yes"`
 * `(if 6 ≤ 4 then "yes" else "no") = "no"`
 * `show 12 ≤ 12 by decide`
 * `show 5 ≤ 12 by decide`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.text
String → Format

Docstring: A node containing a plain string.

If the string contains newlines, the formatter emits them and then indents to the current level.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Std.Format.FlattenBehavior.allOrNone
Std.Format.FlattenBehavior

Docstring: Either all `Format.line`s in the group will be newlines, or all of them will be spaces.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.lgv.path-step-count

\leanhelper  Let $(a,b), (c,d) \in \mathbb {Z}^2$. 

\textbf{Observation 1:} Each path from $(a,b)$ to $(c,d)$ has exactly $c+d-a-b$ steps. 

\textbf{Observation 2:} Each path from $(a,b)$ to $(c,d)$ has exactly $c-a$ east-steps.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.lattice
def.lgv.lattice

We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ (so the vertices are pairs of integers) and arcs 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i+1,j\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}  \]

 and 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i,j+1\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}.  \]

 The arcs of the first form are called \emph{east-steps} or \emph{right-steps}; the arcs of the second form are called \emph{north-steps} or \emph{up-steps}. 

The vertices of this digraph will be called \emph{lattice points} or \emph{grid points} or simply \emph{points}. 

The entire digraph will be denoted by $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ and called the \emph{integer lattice} or \emph{integer grid}. 

Any path is uniquely determined by its starting point and its step sequence.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "Both declarations exactly formalize the two observations. The binders `\u2200 (path : LGV1.LatticePath) (a b c d : \u2124)` cover arbitrary lattice paths and arbitrary points `(a,b),(c,d) \u2208 \u2124\u00b2`, while `path.isPathFromTo (a, b) (c, d)` unfolds to `path.endpoint (a,b) = (c,d)`. A `LatticePath` is a list whose only possible steps are `east` and `north`, and `endpoint` applies these respectively as `(i+1,j)` and `(i,j+1)`, matching the informal lattice definition. For Observation 1, `\u2191path.stepCount = c + d - a - b` uses list length and states exactly \u201chas exactly `c+d-a-b` steps.\u201d For Observation 2, `\u2191path.eastStepCount = c - a` uses `List.count east path` (with equality-derived comparison) and states exactly \u201chas exactly `c-a` east-steps.\u201d The casts merely compare the natural-valued counts in `\u2124`; they add no mathematical hypothesis or restriction."
