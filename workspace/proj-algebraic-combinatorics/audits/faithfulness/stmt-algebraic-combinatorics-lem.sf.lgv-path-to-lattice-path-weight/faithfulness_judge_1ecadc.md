Docstring: The integer lattice digraph ℤ².

This is the same lattice as in LGV1.lean, but using `SimpleDigraph` instead of
Mathlib's `Digraph`. See `integerLattice_arc_iff` for the characterization
and `integerLattice_toDigraph_adj_iff` for the equivalence with LGV1's definition.

Docstring: The arc weight function for the Jacobi-Trudi proof.
East-steps at height j (where 1 ≤ j ≤ N) are weighted by X_{j-1}.
North-steps are weighted by 1.

Note: The lattice uses y-coordinates 1 to N, but Fin N uses 0 to N-1.
An east-step at y-coordinate y gets weight X_{y-1} when 1 ≤ y ≤ N.

      | v₀ :: v₁ :: rest => fun x => if v₁.1 = v₀.1 + 1 ∧ v₁.2 = v₀.2 then v₀.2 :: x.1 else x.1)

each east-step occurs.

      | [head] => fun x => []
      | u :: v :: rest => fun x => if v.1 = u.1 + 1 then u.2 :: x.1 else x.1)
      f

Docstring: Extract y-coordinates at east-step positions from a path vertex list.
For a path from (a, 1) to (c, N), this gives the sequence of y-coordinates
where east-steps occur. The sequence is weakly increasing and has length (c - a).

This is a helper function for constructing the bijection between LGV paths and Sym. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.
For more information: [Equality](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/quantifiers_and_equality.html#equality)


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNat
{n : ℕ} → OfNat ℤ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instNatCastInt
NatCast ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial
Type u_1 → (R : Type u_2) → [CommSemiring R] → Type (max u_2 u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate polynomial, where `σ` is the index set of the variables and
`R` is the coefficient ring 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommSemiring
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → CommSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.nil
{α : Type u} → List α

Docstring: The empty list, usually written `[]`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `[]` in identifiers is `nil`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LT.lt
{α : Type u} → [self : LT α] → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The less-than relation: `x < y` 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `<` in identifiers is `lt`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLTNat
LT ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instHAdd
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.length
{α : Type u_1} → List α → ℕ

Docstring: The length of a list.

This function is overridden in the compiler to `lengthTR`, which uses constant stack space.

Examples:
* `([] : List String).length = 0`
* `["green", "brown"].length = 2`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.get
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → Fin as.length → α

Docstring: Returns the element at the provided index, counting from `0`.

In other words, for `i : Fin as.length`, `as.get i` returns the `i`'th element of the list `as`.
Because the index is a `Fin` bounded by the list's length, the index will never be out of bounds.

Examples:
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (2 : Fin 4) = "fall"`
 * `["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"].get (0 : Fin 4) = "spring"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.mk
{n : ℕ} → (val : ℕ) → val < n → Fin n

Docstring: Creates a `Fin n` from `i : Nat` and a proof that `i < n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.lt_of_succ_lt
∀ {n m : ℕ}, n.succ < m → n < m

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Or
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Or a b`, or `a ∨ b`, is the disjunction of propositions. There are two
constructors for `Or`, called `Or.inl : a → a ∨ b` and `Or.inr : b → a ∨ b`,
and you can use `match` or `cases` to destruct an `Or` assumption into the
two cases.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∨` in identifiers is `or`.

 * The recommended spelling of `\/` in identifiers is `or` (prefer `∨` over `\/`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → α

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instAdd
Add ℤ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.snd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α × β → β

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.head
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Docstring: Returns the first element of a non-empty list.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.getLast
{α : Type u} → (as : List α) → as ≠ [] → α

Docstring: Returns the last element of a non-empty list.

Examples:
* `["circle", "rectangle"].getLast (by decide) = "rectangle"`
* `["circle"].getLast (by decide) = "circle"`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF inferInstance
{α : Sort u} → [i : α] → α

Docstring: `inferInstance` synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass
inference. This function has the same type signature as the identity
function, but the square brackets on the `[i : α]` argument means that it will
attempt to construct this argument by typeclass inference. (This will fail if
`α` is not a `class`.) Example:
```
#check (inferInstance : Inhabited Nat) -- Inhabited Nat

def foo : Inhabited (Nat × Nat) :=
  inferInstance

example : foo.default = (default, default) :=
  rfl
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPolynomial.instCommRingMvPolynomial
{R : Type u} → {σ : Type u_1} → [inst : CommRing R] → CommRing (MvPolynomial σ R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableAnd
{p q : Prop} → [dp : Decidable p] → [dq : Decidable q] → Decidable (p ∧ q)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int.instDecidableEq
DecidableEq ℤ

Docstring: Decides whether two integers are equal. Usually accessed via the `DecidableEq Int` instance.

This function is overridden by the compiler with an efficient implementation. This definition is the
logical model.

Examples:
* `show (7 : Int) = (3 : Int) + (4 : Int) by decide`
* `if (6 : Int) = (3 : Int) * (2 : Int) then "yes" else "no" = "yes"`
* `(¬ (6 : Int) = (3 : Int)) = true`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LE.le
{α : Type u} → [self : LE α] → α → α → Prop

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

functions.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.sf.lgv-path-to-lattice-path-weight

\leanhelper  The LGV arc-weight product of a path equals the lattice path weight of its conversion. This follows from the fact that the arc weight assigns $x_{y-1}$ to east-steps at height $y$, which matches the $\prod x_j$ formula for lattice path weight.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.lgv.lattice
def.lgv.lattice

We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ (so the vertices are pairs of integers) and arcs 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i+1,j\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}  \]

 and 

\[  \left( i,j\right) \rightarrow \left( i,j+1\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for all }\left( i,j\right) \in \mathbb {Z}^{2}.  \]

 The arcs of the first form are called \emph{east-steps} or \emph{right-steps}; the arcs of the second form are called \emph{north-steps} or \emph{up-steps}. 

The vertices of this digraph will be called \emph{lattice points} or \emph{grid points} or simply \emph{points}. 

The entire digraph will be denoted by $\mathbb {Z}^{2}$ and called the \emph{integer lattice} or \emph{integer grid}. 

Any path is uniquely determined by its starting point and its step sequence.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.jt-arc-weight
def.sf.jt-arc-weight

\leanhelper  The arc weight function for the Jacobi–Trudi proof on the integer lattice $\mathbb {Z}^2$: east-steps at height $y$ (with $1 \leq y \leq N$) are weighted by $x_{y-1}$; north-steps are weighted by $1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.sf.lgv-path-to-lattice-path
def.sf.lgv-path-to-lattice-path

\leanhelper  Convert an LGV path (in the integer lattice digraph) from $(a, 1)$ to $(c, N)$ into a lattice path by extracting the $y$-coordinates at which east-steps occur and converting them to $\mathrm{Fin}\, N$ values (by subtracting $1$).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target exactly states the claimed equality: `LGV.pathWeight SymmetricFunctions.jacobiTrudiArcWeight p = (SymmetricFunctions.lgvPathToLatticePath a c p hstart hfinish).weight`. Its binders restrict `p` precisely as required by the informal conversion definition, namely `hstart : p.start = (a, 1)` and `hfinish : p.finish = (c, \u2191N)`, matching \u201can LGV path ... from `(a, 1)` to `(c, N)`.\u201d The dependency bodies also match the stated meanings: `jacobiTrudiArcWeight` assigns `X \u27e8(u.2 - 1).toNat, ...\u27e9` to east-steps at heights `1 \u2264 u.2 \u2264 N` and `1` otherwise, while `LatticePath.weight` is the product of `MvPolynomial.X j` over the converted east-step heights. The arbitrary `[CommRing R]` supplies the coefficient setting needed by these polynomial and path-weight definitions and does not introduce a mathematically conflicting restriction."
