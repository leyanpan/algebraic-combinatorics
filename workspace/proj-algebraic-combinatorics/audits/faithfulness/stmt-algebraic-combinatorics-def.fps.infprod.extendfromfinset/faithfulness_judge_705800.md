## TARGET PowerSeries.extendFromFinset (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{I : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq I] → (In : Finset I) → (↥In → ℕ) → I → ℕ

Body:
fun {I} [DecidableEq I] In f i => if h : i ∈ In then f ⟨i, h⟩ else 0

Docstring: Extend a function from a finite subset to the full type by setting values to 0 outside. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SetLike.instMembership
{A : Type u_1} → {B : Type u_2} → [i : SetLike A B] → Membership B A

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSetLike
{α : Type u_1} → SetLike (Finset α) α

Docstring: Convert a finset to a set in the natural way. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF dite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → (c → α) → (¬c → α) → α

Docstring: "Dependent" if-then-else, normally written via the notation `if h : c then t(h) else e(h)`,
is sugar for `dite c (fun h => t(h)) (fun h => e(h))`, and it is the same as
`if c then t else e` except that `t` is allowed to depend on a proof `h : c`,
and `e` can depend on `h : ¬c`. (Both branches use the same name for the hypothesis,
even though it has different types in the two cases.)

We use this to be able to communicate the if-then-else condition to the branches.
For example, `Array.get arr i h` expects a proof `h : i < arr.size` in order to
avoid a bounds check, so you can write `if h : i < arr.size then arr.get i h else ...`
to avoid the bounds check inside the if branch. (Of course in this case we have only
lifted the check into an explicit `if`, but we could also use this proof multiple times
or derive `i < arr.size` from some other proposition that we are checking in the `if`.)


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.decidableMem
{α : Type u_1} → [_h : DecidableEq α] → (a : α) → (s : Finset α) → Decidable (a ∈ s)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype.mk
{α : Sort u} → {p : α → Prop} → (val : α) → p val → Subtype p

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `¬` in identifiers is `not`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.fps.infprod.extendFromFinset

\leanhelper  Given a finite subset $I_n \subseteq I$ and a function $f : I_n \to \mathbb {N}$, \emph{extend from finset} produces a function $I \to \mathbb {N}$ by setting $f(i)$ for $i \in I_n$ and $0$ otherwise. This is used in the bijection between essentially finite families supported on $I_n$ and functions $I_n \to S$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.essfinite
def.fps.infprod.essFinite

\leanhelper  A family $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ of natural numbers is \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many entries equal $0$, i.e., the set $\{ i \in I : k_i \neq 0\} $ is finite. This corresponds to $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ in the source.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.sfini
def.fps.infprod.SfinI

\leanhelper  The set $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ of \emph{essentially finite families} in $\prod _{i \in I} S_i$ is the set of all families $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ such that $k_i \in S_i$ for all $i$ and the family $(k_i)$ is essentially finite.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint asks for, \u201cGiven a finite subset $I_n \\subseteq I$ and a function $f : I_n \\to \\mathbb N$,\u201d a function $I \\to \\mathbb N$ taking \u201c$f(i)$ for $i \\in I_n$ and $0$ otherwise.\u201d The signature `(In : Finset I) \u2192 (\u21a5In \u2192 \u2115) \u2192 I \u2192 \u2115` represents exactly a finite subset, a function on its subtype, and the resulting total function. Its body `if h : i \u2208 In then f \u27e8i, h\u27e9 else 0` implements the stated two cases exactly. The `[DecidableEq I]` binder supplies decidable finset membership needed to execute the conditional; it is an encoding/computability requirement rather than a mathematically contentful restriction on the construction."
