Docstring: Chu-Vandermonde identity for binomial rings (Theorem thm.binom.vandermonde.CC)
Label: eq.prop.binom.vandermonde.CC.eq

This generalizes Vandermonde's identity from natural numbers to any binomial ring
(including ℚ, ℝ, ℂ, and polynomial rings). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF BinomialRing
(R : Type u_1) → [AddCommMonoid R] → [Pow R ℕ] → Type u_1

Docstring: A binomial ring is a ring for which ascending Pochhammer evaluations are uniquely divisible by
suitable factorials. We define this notion as a mixin for additive commutative monoids with natural
number powers, but retain the ring name. We introduce `Ring.multichoose` as the uniquely defined
quotient.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ring.choose
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : AddCommGroupWithOne R] → [inst_1 : Pow R ℕ] → [BinomialRing R] → R → ℕ → R

Docstring: The binomial coefficient `choose r n` generalizes the natural number `Nat.choose` function,
interpreted in terms of choosing without replacement.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.HasAntidiagonal.antidiagonal

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

Docstring: The second element of a pair. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
Vandermonde convolution identity, aka Chu–Vandermonde identity

Let $a,b\in \mathbb {C}$, and let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Then, 

\[  \binom {a+b}{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}\binom {a}{k}\binom {b}{n-k}.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.binom.binom
def.binom.binom

For any numbers $n$ and $k$, we set

\begin{equation}  \binom {n}{k}=\begin{cases}  \frac{n\left( n-1\right) \left( n-2\right) \cdots \left( n-k+1\right) }{k!}, &  \text{if }k\in \mathbb {N};\\ 0, &  \text{else.}\end{cases} \end{equation}

 Note that “numbers” is to be understood fairly liberally here. In particular, $n$ can be any integer, rational, real or complex number (or, more generally, any element in a $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra), whereas $k$ can be anything (although the only nonzero values of $\binom {n}{k}$ will be achieved for $k\in \mathbb {N}$, by the above definition).

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies over \u201ca,b\u2208\u2102\u201d and \u201cn\u2208\u2115\u201d and asserts `binom (a+b) n = \u2211_{k=0}^n binom a k binom b (n-k)`. The Lean theorem quantifies more generally over `\u2200 {S : Type u_2} [CommRing S] [BinomialRing S] (a b : S) (n : \u2115)`, which is a genuine generalization rather than a weakening; its stated setting includes \u2102. `Ring.choose` is documented as the binomial coefficient \u201cinterpreted in terms of choosing without replacement,\u201d matching the blueprint\u2019s falling-factorial definition. Finally, `\u2211 ij \u2208 Finset.antidiagonal n, ... ij.1 ... ij.2` ranges over exactly the natural-number pairs `(k,j)` satisfying `k+j=n`; equivalently these are `(k,n-k)` for `0\u2264k\u2264n`. Thus the formal right-hand side is precisely the stated convolution sum."
