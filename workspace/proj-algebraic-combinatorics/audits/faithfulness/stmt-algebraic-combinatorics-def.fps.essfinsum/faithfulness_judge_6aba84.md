Docstring: A family is essentially finite if its support is finite.
(Definition def.infsum.essfin (a))

**This is an alias** for the canonical `EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.fps.essFinSum

\leanhelper  For an essentially finite family $(a_i)_{i\in I}$, the \emph{essentially finite sum} $\sum _{i\in I} a_i$ is defined as $\sum _{i\in S} a_i$ where $S = \{ i\in I \mid a_i \neq 0\} $.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.infsum.essfin
def.infsum.essfin

\textbf{(a)} A family $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ of elements of $K$ is said to be \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many $i\in I$ satisfy $a_{i}=0$ (in other words, if the set $\left\{ i\in I\  \mid \  a_{i}\neq 0\right\} $ is finite). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} Let $\left(a_{i}\right)_{i\in I}\in K^{I}$ be an essentially finite family of elements of $K$. Then, the infinite sum $\sum _{i\in I}a_{i}$ is defined to equal the finite sum $\sum _{\substack {i\in I;\\ a_{i}\neq 0}}a_{i}$. Such an infinite sum is said to be \emph{essentially finite}.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The body correctly implements the stated sum: `\u2211 i \u2208 Set.Finite.toFinset hf, f i`, where `hf` means `(Function.support f).Finite` and `Function.support f = {i | f i \u2260 0}`. Thus it sums exactly over the finite set specified by the blueprint. However, the elaborated signature adds the mathematically substantive binder `[inst : CommRing R]`, while the informal statement and definition only speak of a family in `K` and a finite sum; they do not require multiplication, additive inverses, or commutative multiplication. This unnecessarily restricts the definition to commutative rings. The restriction also appears in the alias `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite`, whose binder is `[CommRing R]`, although its canonical body only needs `[Zero M]`. To make the declaration faithful, `essFinSum` should require only the additive structure needed by `Finset.sum`, such as `[AddCommMonoid R]`, and either use the canonical root `EssentiallyFinite` directly or generalize the project alias from `[CommRing R]` to `[Zero R]`."
