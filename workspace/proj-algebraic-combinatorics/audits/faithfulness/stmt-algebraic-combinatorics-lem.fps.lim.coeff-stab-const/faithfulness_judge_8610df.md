  ∀ (n : ℕ), Seq.StabilizesTo (fun i => (PowerSeries.coeff n) (f i)) ((PowerSeries.coeff n) lim)

Docstring: A sequence of FPSs `(f_i)_{i ∈ ℕ}` coefficientwise stabilizes to `f` if for each `n ∈ ℕ`,
the sequence `([x^n] f_i)_{i ∈ ℕ}` stabilizes to `[x^n] f`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

Docstring: A map `f` between an `R`-module and an `S`-module over a ring homomorphism `σ : R →+* S`
is semilinear if it satisfies the two properties `f (x + y) = f x + f y` and
`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time.

Docstring: The `n`th coefficient of a formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF GE.ge

Docstring: `a ≥ b` is an abbreviation for `b ≤ a`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≥` in identifiers is `ge`.

 * The recommended spelling of `>=` in identifiers is `ge` (prefer `≥` over `>=`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instLENat
LE ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.lim.coeff-stab-const

\leanhelper  A constant sequence $(g, g, g, \ldots )$ of FPSs coefficientwise stabilizes to $g$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.coeff-stab
def.fps.lim.coeff-stab

Let $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] ^{\mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of FPSs over $K$. Let $f\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $ be an FPS. 

We say that $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ \emph{coefficientwise stabilizes to }$f$ if for each $n\in \mathbb {N}$,

\[  \text{the sequence }\left( \left[ x^{n}\right] f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}\text{ stabilizes to }\left[ x^{n}\right] f.  \]

If $f_{i}$ coefficientwise stabilizes to $f$ as $i\rightarrow \infty $, then we write $\lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }f_{i}=f$ and say that $f$ is the \emph{limit} of $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$. This is legitimate, because $f$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $\left( f_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.stab
def.fps.lim.stab

Let $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of elements of $K$. Let $a\in K$. 

We say that the sequence $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$ \emph{stabilizes to }$a$ if there exists some $N\in \mathbb {N}$ such that

\[  \text{all integers }i\geq N\text{ satisfy }a_{i}=a.  \]

If $a_{i}$ stabilizes to $a$ as $i\rightarrow \infty $, then we write $\lim \limits _{i\rightarrow \infty }a_{i}=a$ and say that $a$ is the \emph{limit} (or \emph{eventual value}) of $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$. This is legitimate, since $a$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in \mathbb {N}}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The target quantifies only over `\u2200 {K : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing K] (g : PowerSeries K)`, whereas the blueprint says simply \u201cA constant sequence `(g,g,g,\u2026)` of FPSs coefficientwise stabilizes to `g`.\u201d Its definition of an FPS is a sequence in `K^\u2115`, and neither that definition nor the stabilization definitions require `K` to be a commutative ring. Thus `[CommRing K]` is a mathematically contentful added hypothesis, restricting the claim. The restriction enters through the `[CommRing K]` binder of `PowerSeries.CoeffStabilizesTo` (and is inherited by the target); moreover, the supplied `PowerSeries.coeff` interface itself requires at least `[Semiring K]`. To make the formalization faithful, coefficientwise stabilization/coefficient access would need to be generalized to arbitrary coefficient types, matching FPSs as sequences in `K`, and the target\u2019s `[CommRing K]` binder removed. Alternatively, the blueprint would have to explicitly assume that `K` is a commutative ring."
