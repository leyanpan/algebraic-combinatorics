## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.fps_eq_of_sq_eq (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] (f g : PowerSeries R),
  PowerSeries.subst (PowerSeries.X ^ 2) f = PowerSeries.subst (PowerSeries.X ^ 2) g → f = g

Docstring: **Lemma \ref{lem.fps.fxx=gxx}**: If f[x²] = g[x²], then f = g.

This justifies "substituting x for x²" in the proof of Euler's pentagonal theorem
from Jacobi's triple product identity.

The key insight is: if f = ∑_n f_n x^n and g = ∑_n g_n x^n, then
  f[x²] = ∑_n f_n x^{2n}  and  g[x²] = ∑_n g_n x^{2n}

So if f[x²] = g[x²], comparing x^{2n}-coefficients gives f_n = g_n for all n,
hence f = g.

Here f[x²] denotes the substitution of x² for x in f, i.e., `PowerSeries.subst (X^2) f`.
This substitution is well-defined because X² has zero constant coefficient,
satisfying the `HasSubst` condition.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type u_2 → Type (max (max u_2 0) u_1)

Docstring: Multivariate formal power series, where `σ` is the index set of the variables
and `R` is the coefficient ring. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

Docstring: `a ^ b` computes `a` to the power of `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `^` in identifiers is `pow`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.fxx=gxx

Let $K$ be a commutative ring. Let $f$ and $g$ be two FPSs in $K[[x]]$. Assume that $f[x^{2}]=g[x^{2}]$. Then, $f=g$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

\end{bgroup}}}a_{i}b_{j}\\ &  =a_{0}b_{n}+a_{1}b_{n-1}+a_{2}b_{n-2}+\cdots +a_{n}b_{0}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{for each }n\in \mathbb {N}. \end{align*}

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.x
def.fps.x

Let $x$ denote the FPS $\left(0,1,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. In other words, let $x$ denote the FPS with $\left[x^{1}\right]x=1$ and $\left[x^{i}\right]x=0$ for all $i\neq 1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.xneq
def.fps.xneq

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $f,g\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ be two FPSs. We write $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$ if and only if 

\[  \text{each }m\in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots ,n\right\} \text{ satisfies } \left[x^{m}\right]f=\left[x^{m}\right]g.  \]

Thus, we have defined a binary relation $\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }$ on the set $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$. We say that an FPS $f$ is $x^{n}$\emph{-equivalent} to an FPS $g$ if and only if $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The blueprint quantifies over a commutative ring and two formal power series: \u201cLet K be a commutative ring. Let f and g be two FPSs in K[[x]].\u201d This matches `\u2200 {R : Type u_1} [inst : CommRing R] (f g : PowerSeries R)`. Its hypothesis and conclusion, \u201cAssume that f[x\u00b2] = g[x\u00b2]. Then, f = g,\u201d match `PowerSeries.subst (PowerSeries.X ^ 2) f = PowerSeries.subst (PowerSeries.X ^ 2) g \u2192 f = g`. By the supplied library meanings, `PowerSeries.subst` is substitution and `PowerSeries.X` is the formal power-series variable, so the formal hypothesis has the intended meaning. There are no additional contentful hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
