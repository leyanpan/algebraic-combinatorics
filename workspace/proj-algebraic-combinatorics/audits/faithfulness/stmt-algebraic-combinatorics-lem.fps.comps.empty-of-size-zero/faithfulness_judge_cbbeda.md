## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition.empty_of_size_zero (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ (α : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition), α.size = 0 → α = []

Docstring: The empty list is the only composition of size 0.


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition (def)
Type

Body:
List ℕ+

Docstring: An integer composition is a finite tuple of positive integers.
We represent it as a list of positive integers.

(Definition def.fps.comps, part (a))


## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition.size (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition → ℕ

Body:
fun α => (List.map (fun x => ↑x) α).sum

Docstring: The size of a composition is the sum of its entries.

(Definition def.fps.comps, part (b))


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.nil
{α : Type u} → List α

Docstring: The empty list, usually written `[]`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `[]` in identifiers is `nil`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PNat
Type

Docstring: `ℕ+` is the type of positive natural numbers. It is defined as a subtype,
and the VM representation of `ℕ+` is the same as `ℕ` because the proof
is not stored. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.sum
{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → [Zero α] → List α → α

Docstring: Computes the sum of the elements of a list.

Examples:
* `[a, b, c].sum = a + (b + (c + 0))`
* `[1, 2, 5].sum = 8`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α → β) → List α → List β

Docstring: Applies a function to each element of the list, returning the resulting list of values.

`O(|l|)`.

Examples:
* `[a, b, c].map f = [f a, f b, f c]`
* `[].map Nat.succ = []`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.length) = [3, 3, 5]`
* `["one", "two", "three"].map (·.reverse) = ["eno", "owt", "eerht"]`


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PNat.val
ℕ+ → ℕ

Docstring: The underlying natural number 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT

\leanhelper  The empty list is the only composition of size $0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.wcomps
def.fps.wcomps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) weak composition} means a (finite) tuple of nonnegative integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of a weak composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of a weak composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{weak composition of }$n$ means a weak composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{weak composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a weak composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint\u2019s supplied definition says that a weak composition is \u201ca (finite) tuple of nonnegative integers,\u201d whereas the target quantifies `\u2200 (\u03b1 : AlgebraicCombinatorics.Composition)` and `Composition` is defined as `List \u2115+`, i.e. lists of positive integers. Thus the binder restricts the quantified objects from weak compositions to positive-part compositions, making the formal theorem weaker. Indeed, a weak composition such as `(0)` has size `0` but is not empty, while it is excluded by `List \u2115+`. To match the supplied informal definition, the target would need to quantify over a weak-composition type such as `List \u2115` with size given by the sum; alternatively, the blueprint statement/definition would need to specify ordinary compositions with positive entries. Under the weak-composition definition, the stated blueprint claim is expressible but false."
