## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.CycleDecomposition.cyc_eq_of_isRotated (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {α : Type u_1} [inst : DecidableEq α] {l₁ l₂ : List α}, l₁ ~r l₂ → l₁.Nodup → l₁.formPerm = l₂.formPerm

Docstring: Two lists that are cyclic rotations of each other give the same cycle. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List
Type u → Type u

Docstring: Linked lists: ordered lists, in which each element has a reference to the next element.

Most operations on linked lists take time proportional to the length of the list, because each
element must be traversed to find the next element.

`List α` is isomorphic to `Array α`, but they are useful for different things:
* `List α` is easier for reasoning, and `Array α` is modeled as a wrapper around `List α`.
* `List α` works well as a persistent data structure, when many copies of the tail are shared. When
  the value is not shared, `Array α` will have better performance because it can do destructive
  updates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.IsRotated
{α : Type u} → List α → List α → Prop

Docstring: `IsRotated l₁ l₂` or `l₁ ~r l₂` asserts that `l₁` and `l₂` are cyclic permutations
of each other. This is defined by claiming that `∃ n, l.rotate n = l'`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.Nodup
{α : Type u} → List α → Prop

Docstring: The list has no duplicates: it contains every element at most once.

It is defined as `Pairwise (· ≠ ·)`: each element is unequal to all other elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Equiv.Perm
Sort u_1 → Sort (max 1 u_1)

Docstring: `Perm α` is the type of bijections from `α` to itself. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF List.formPerm
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → List α → Equiv.Perm α

Docstring: A list `l : List α` can be interpreted as an `Equiv.Perm α` where each element in the list
is permuted to the next one, defined as `formPerm`. When we have that `Nodup l`,
we prove that `Equiv.Perm.support (formPerm l) = l.toFinset`, and that
`formPerm l` is rotationally invariant, in `formPerm_rotate`.


## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.cyc_eq_of_isRotated

\leanhelper  Let $l_1, l_2$ be lists such that $l_1$ is a cyclic rotation of $l_2$, and $l_1$ has no duplicate entries. Then $l_1$ and $l_2$ give rise to the same cycle permutation.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.dcdlisttoperm
def.dcdListToPerm

\leanhelper  Given a list of lists (each representing a cycle), the corresponding permutation is obtained by composing the cycle permutations $\operatorname {cyc}_{a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m}$ for each list $(a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_m)$ in the input.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.comps
def.fps.comps

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) composition} means a (finite) tuple of positive integers. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{size} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $\alpha _{1}+\alpha _{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{m}$. It is written $\left\vert \alpha \right\vert $. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} The \emph{length} of an integer composition $\alpha =\left( \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{m}\right) $ is defined to be the integer $m$. It is written $\ell \left( \alpha \right) $. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$ means a composition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{composition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a composition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.pars.parts
def.pars.parts

\textbf{(a)} An \emph{(integer) partition} means a (finite) weakly decreasing tuple of positive integers – i.e., a finite tuple $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ of positive integers such that $\lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{m}$. 

Thus, partitions are the same as weakly decreasing compositions. Hence, the notions of \emph{size} and \emph{length} of a partition are automatically defined, since we have defined them for compositions (in Definition \ref{def.fps.comps}). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{parts} of a partition $\left( \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}\right) $ are simply its entries $\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},\ldots ,\lambda _{m}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$ means a partition whose size is $n$. \medskip 

\textbf{(d)} Let $n\in \mathbb {Z}$ and $k\in \mathbb {N}$. A \emph{partition of }$n$\emph{ into }$k$\emph{ parts} is a partition whose size is $n$ and whose length is $k$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs
def.perm.cycs

Let $X$ be a set. Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k$ be $k$ distinct elements of $X$. Then, 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}  \]

 means the permutation of $X$ that sends 

\begin{align*} & i_1 \text{ to } i_2, \\ & i_2 \text{ to } i_3, \\ & \ldots , \\ & i_{k-1} \text{ to } i_k, \\ & i_k \text{ to } i_1 \end{align*}

 and leaves all other elements of $X$ unchanged. In other words, $\operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k}$ means the permutation of $X$ that satisfies 

\[  \operatorname {cyc}_{i_1, \ldots , i_k}(p) = \begin{cases}  i_{j+1}, &  \text{if } p = i_j \text{ for some } j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} ;\\ p, &  \text{otherwise} \end{cases}  \]

 for every $p \in X$, where $i_{k+1}$ means $i_1$. 

This permutation is called a $k$\emph{-cycle}.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.cycs.cycs
def.perm.cycs.cycs

Let $X$ be a finite set. Let $\sigma $ be a permutation of $X$. \medskip 

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{cycles} of $\sigma $ are defined to be the cycles in the DCD of $\sigma $ (as defined in Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} \textbf{(a)}). (This includes $1$-cycles, if there are any in the DCD of $\sigma $.) 

We shall equate a cycle of $\sigma $ with any of its cyclic rotations; thus, for example, $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 1,4,3\right) $ shall be regarded as being the same cycle (but $\left( 3,1,4\right) $ and $\left( 3,4,1\right) $ shall not). \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{cycle lengths partition} of $\sigma $ shall denote the partition of $\left\vert X\right\vert $ obtained by writing down the lengths of the cycles of $\sigma $ in weakly decreasing order.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.perm.perm
def.perm.perm

Let $X$ be a set. 

\textbf{(a)} A \emph{permutation} of $X$ means a bijection from $X$ to $X$. 

\textbf{(b)} It is known that the set of all permutations of $X$ is a group under composition. This group is called the \emph{symmetric group} of $X$, and is denoted by $S_X$. Its neutral element is the identity map $\operatorname {id}_X : X \to X$. Its size is $|X|!$ when $X$ is finite. 

\textbf{(c)} As usual in group theory, we will write $\alpha \beta $ for the composition $\alpha \circ \beta $ when $\alpha , \beta \in S_X$. This is the map that sends each $x \in X$ to $\alpha (\beta (x))$. 

\textbf{(d)} If $\alpha \in S_X$ and $i \in \mathbb {Z}$, then $\alpha ^i$ shall denote the $i$-th power of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$. Note that $\alpha ^i = \underbrace{\alpha \circ \alpha \circ \cdots \circ \alpha }_{i\text{ times}}$ if $i \ge 0$. Also, $\alpha ^0 = \operatorname {id}_X$. Also, $\alpha ^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\alpha $ in the group $S_X$, that is, the inverse of the map $\alpha $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The formal binders exactly match the blueprint: `l\u2081 ~r l\u2082` asserts that the lists are cyclic rotations, `l\u2081.Nodup` matches \u201c`l\u2081` has no duplicate entries,\u201d and the conclusion `l\u2081.formPerm = l\u2082.formPerm` states that they give rise to the same permutation. By the `List.formPerm` docstring, each list is interpreted as the permutation sending each entry to the next, which agrees with the informal cycle definition. The binder `[DecidableEq \u03b1]` is an implementation requirement for `List.formPerm`, not an additional mathematical hypothesis about the lists."
