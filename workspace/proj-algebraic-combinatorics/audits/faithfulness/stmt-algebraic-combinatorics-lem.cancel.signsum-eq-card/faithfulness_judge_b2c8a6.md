## TARGET AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signSum_eq_card (theorem) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
∀ {d : ℕ} (e : Fin d → ZMod 2),
  AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signSum e =
    ↑d - 2 * ↑(AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signTupleToSubset e).card

Docstring: For a sign tuple corresponding to subset S, the sum of entries
equals `d - 2|S|`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signSum (def)
{d : ℕ} → (Fin d → ZMod 2) → ℤ

Body:
fun {d} e => ∑ k, AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.toSign (e k)

Docstring: The sum of entries of a sign tuple, as an integer 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.signTupleToSubset (def)
{d : ℕ} → (Fin d → ZMod 2) → Finset (Fin d)

Body:
fun {d} e => {k | e k = 1}

Docstring: Bijection between sign tuples and subsets of `[d]`:
A sign tuple `(e_1, ..., e_d) ∈ {1,-1}^d` corresponds to the set
`{i ∈ [d] | e_i = -1}` of positions with -1. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.SubtractiveMethods.toSign (def)
ZMod 2 → ℤ

Body:
fun b => if b = 0 then 1 else -1

Docstring: Convert a ZMod 2 value to a sign: 0 ↦ 1, 1 ↦ -1 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF ZMod
ℕ → Type

Docstring: The integers modulo `n : ℕ`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat
(n : ℕ) → OfNat ℕ n

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `=` in identifiers is `eq`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HSub.hSub
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HSub α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a - b` computes the difference of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.
* For natural numbers, this operator saturates at 0: `a - b = 0` when `a ≤ b`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `-` in identifiers is `sub` (when used as a binary operator).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.cast
{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.sum
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [AddCommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∑ x ∈ s, f x` is the sum of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements
of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∑ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∑ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available).

(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (ZMod n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF ite
{α : Sort u} → (c : Prop) → [h : Decidable c] → α → α → α

Docstring: `if c then t else e` is notation for `ite c t e`, "if-then-else", which decides to
return `t` or `e` depending on whether `c` is true or false. The explicit argument
`c : Prop` does not have any actual computational content, but there is an additional
`[Decidable c]` argument synthesized by typeclass inference which actually
determines how to evaluate `c` to true or false. Write `if h : c then t else e`
instead for a "dependent if-then-else" `dite`, which allows `t`/`e` to use the fact
that `c` is true/false.

The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.cancel.signSum-eq-card

\leanhelper  For a sign tuple $e \in \{ 1,-1\} ^d$, let $S = \{ i \in [d] \mid e_i = -1\} $. Then 

\[  e_1 + e_2 + \cdots + e_d = d - 2|S|.  \]

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.cancel.signtupletosubset
Sign tuple to subset

\leanhelper  The map $\operatorname {signTupleToSubset} : (\operatorname {Fin} d \to \mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z}) \to \mathcal{P}(\operatorname {Fin} d)$ sends a sign tuple $e$ to the set $S = \{ k \in \operatorname {Fin} d \mid e_k = 1\} $ (i.e., the positions where $\operatorname {toSign}(e_k) = -1$).

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.cancel.tosign
Sign conversion

\leanhelper  The function $\operatorname {toSign} : \mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}$ converts elements of $\mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z}$ to signs: $\operatorname {toSign}(0) = 1$ and $\operatorname {toSign}(1) = -1$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies over exactly the encoded sign tuples, `\u2200 {d : \u2115} (e : Fin d \u2192 ZMod 2)`, as fixed by the informal definitions. Its left side unfolds to `\u2211 k, toSign (e k)`, matching `e\u2081 + \u22ef + e_d`, with `toSign(0) = 1` and `toSign(1) = -1`. Its subset unfolds to `{k | e k = 1}`, exactly the informal definition\u2019s positions where `toSign(e_k) = -1`. Therefore the conclusion `signSum e = \u2191d - 2 * \u2191(signTupleToSubset e).card` is precisely the integer-valued identity `e\u2081 + \u22ef + e_d = d - 2|S|`, with no added hypotheses or restricted quantifiers."
