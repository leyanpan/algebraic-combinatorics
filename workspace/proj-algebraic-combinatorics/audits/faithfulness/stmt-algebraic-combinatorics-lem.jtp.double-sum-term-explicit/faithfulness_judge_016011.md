∀ (P N : Finset ℕ),
  (∏ n ∈ P, (AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiFactorZ n - 1)) * ∏ n ∈ N, (AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiFactorZInv n - 1) =

      AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiZPow (↑P.card - ↑N.card)

Docstring: The explicit form of each term in the double sum.
For a pair (P, N) of finite subsets of ℕ:
  (∏_{n∈P} (jacobiFactorZ n - 1)) * (∏_{n∈N} (jacobiFactorZInv n - 1))
  = X^{∑_{n∈P}(2n+1) + ∑_{n∈N}(2n+1)} * z^{|P| - |N|}

This uses the explicit formulas for the products. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing (def)
Type

Body:
PowerSeries (LaurentPolynomial ℤ)

Docstring: The ring (ℤ[z^±])[[q]] for Jacobi's triple product identity.
This is the ring of formal power series in q with coefficients that are
Laurent polynomials in z over ℤ. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiFactorZ (def)
ℕ → AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing

Body:
fun n => 1 + PowerSeries.X ^ (2 * n + 1) * AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiZ

Docstring: The factor (1 + q^{2n-1}z) in Jacobi's product, for n ≥ 1.
Here we index by n starting from 0, so the exponent is 2n+1. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiFactorZInv (def)
ℕ → AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing

Body:
fun n => 1 + PowerSeries.X ^ (2 * n + 1) * AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiZInv

Docstring: The factor (1 + q^{2n-1}z^{-1}) in Jacobi's product. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiZPow (def)
ℤ → AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing

Body:
fun ell => PowerSeries.C (LaurentPolynomial.T ell)

Docstring: z^ℓ for any integer ℓ, as a constant power series. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiZ (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing

Body:
PowerSeries.C (LaurentPolynomial.T 1)

Docstring: The Laurent polynomial variable z, viewed as a constant power series in JacobiRing.
This represents z = T(1) where T is the Laurent polynomial basis element. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY AlgebraicCombinatorics.jacobiZInv (def)
AlgebraicCombinatorics.JacobiRing

Body:
PowerSeries.C (LaurentPolynomial.T (-1))

Docstring: The inverse z^{-1} = T(-1) as a constant power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HMul.hMul
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HMul α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a * b` computes the product of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `*` in identifiers is `mul`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF LaurentPolynomial
(R : Type u_3) → [Semiring R] → Type u_3

Docstring: The semiring of Laurent polynomials with coefficients in the semiring `R`.
We denote it by `R[T;T⁻¹]`.
The ring homomorphism `C : R →+* R[T;T⁻¹]` includes `R` as the constant polynomials. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Int
Type

Docstring: The integers.

This type is special-cased by the compiler and overridden with an efficient implementation. The
runtime has a special representation for `Int` that stores “small” signed numbers directly, while
larger numbers use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A “small number” is an integer that can be encoded with one fewer bits
than the platform's pointer size (i.e. 63 bits on 64-bit architectures and 31 bits on 32-bit
architectures).

`α`.

{R : Type u} → [NatCast R] → ℕ → R

Docstring: The canonical homomorphism `Nat → R`. In most use cases, the target type will have a (semi)ring
structure, and this homomorphism should be a (semi)ring homomorphism.

`NatCast` and `IntCast` exist to allow different libraries with their own types that can be notated
as natural numbers to have consistent `simp` normal forms without needing to create coercion
simplification sets that are aware of all combinations. Libraries should make it easy to work with
`NatCast` where possible. For instance, in Mathlib there will be such a homomorphism (and thus a
`NatCast R` instance) whenever `R` is an additive monoid with a `1`.

The prototypical example is `Int.ofNat`.

Docstring: The function `n ↦ T ^ n`, implemented as a sequence `ℤ → R[T;T⁻¹]`.

Using directly `T ^ n` does not work, since we want the exponents to be of Type `ℤ` and there
is no `ℤ`-power defined on `R[T;T⁻¹]`.  Using that `T` is a unit introduces extra coercions.
For these reasons, the definition of `T` is as a sequence.

In this section, we will mostly be using FPSs in the indeterminate $q$. That is, we call the indeterminate $q$ rather than $x$. The ring of FPSs in the indeterminate $q$ over a commutative ring $K$ will be denoted by $K[[q]]$. The ring of polynomials in the indeterminate $q$ over $K$ will be denoted by $K[q]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip

\textbf{(b)} We let $K\left[ x\right] $ be the set of all polynomials $a\in K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $. This set $K\left[ x\right] $ is a subring of $K\left[ \left[ x\right] \right] $ (according to Theorem \ref{thm.fps.pol.ring} below), and is called the \emph{univariate polynomial ring} over $K$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target quantifies over exactly the required finite subsets, `\u2200 (P N : Finset \u2115)`, matching the informal products over finite sets `P` and `N`. By the dependency bodies, `jacobiFactorZ n - 1 = (1 + PowerSeries.X^(2*n+1) * jacobiZ) - 1`, hence represents `q^(2n+1) z`, and similarly `jacobiFactorZInv n - 1` represents `q^(2n+1) z\u207b\u00b9`. The right side `PowerSeries.X ^ (\u2211 n \u2208 P, (2*n+1) + \u2211 n \u2208 N, (2*n+1)) * jacobiZPow (\u2191P.card - \u2191N.card)` exactly formalizes `q^{\u2211_{n\u2208P}(2n+1)+\u2211_{n\u2208N}(2n+1)} \u00b7 z^{|P|-|N|}`; in particular, the casts make the cardinality difference an integer, as required for a Laurent power of `z`. The fixed ambient ring `PowerSeries (LaurentPolynomial \u2124)` is also precisely the stated `(\u001b[1m\u2124\u001b[0m[z^{\u00b1}])[[q]]` setting."
