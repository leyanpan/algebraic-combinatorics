Docstring: Claim 7: The family `(∏_{i ∈ I} p_{i,k_i})` indexed by essentially finite families
`(k_i)_{i ∈ I} ∈ S^I_fin` supported on `I_n` is summable. That is, for each `n ∈ ℕ`,
only finitely many essentially finite families `(k_i)` supported on `I_n` satisfy
`[x^n](∏_{i ∈ I_n} p_{i,k_i}) ≠ 0`.

The proof shows that any k with nonzero coefficient must satisfy:
- Property 1: All i ∉ I_n satisfy k i = 0 (support contained in I_n) - explicit in statement
- Property 2: All i ∈ I_n satisfy k i ∈ K_n ∪ {0}
These two properties restrict k to finitely many possibilities.

Note: Property 1 is made explicit in the statement since the product is over the finite set I_n.
For the infinite product interpretation (with p_{i,0} = 1), this constraint follows from
the fact that factors with k_i ≠ 0 for i ∉ I_n would have vanishing coefficients up to
degree n, making the product coefficient zero (by Claim 5/6).

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSetUnion (def)
{K : Type u_1} → [CommRing K] → {I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) → ℕ → Set (I × ℕ)

Body:
fun {K} [CommRing K] {I} p n => ⋃ m ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSet p m

Docstring: The union of coefficient support sets up to degree n.
This corresponds to `T'_n = T_0 ∪ T_1 ∪ ... ∪ T_n`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.IndexSetIn (def)
{K : Type u_1} → [CommRing K] → {I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) → ℕ → Set I

Body:

Docstring: The index set `I_n` of first components appearing in `T'_n`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.ValueSetKn (def)
{K : Type u_1} → [CommRing K] → {I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) → ℕ → Set ℕ

Body:
fun {K} [CommRing K] {I} p n => {k | ∃ i, (i, k) ∈ PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSetUnion p n}

Docstring: The value set `K_n` of second components appearing in `T'_n`. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} f => EssentiallyFinite f

Docstring: A family `f : I → ℕ` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are 0.
This corresponds to `S^I_fin` in the source.

**This is an alias** for the canonical `_root_.EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`.

This version is specialized to `ℕ` for use in product rule proofs. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSet (def)
{K : Type u_1} → [CommRing K] → {I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ → PowerSeries K) → ℕ → Set (I × ℕ)

Body:
fun {K} [CommRing K] {I} p m => {ik | ik.2 ≠ 0 ∧ (PowerSeries.coeff m) (p ik.1 ik.2) ≠ 0}

Docstring: For a summable family `(p_{i,k})`, the set `T_m` of pairs `(i,k)` with nonzero
`[x^m] p_{i,k}` is finite. This corresponds to equation (pf.prop.fps.prodrule-fin-inf.Tm-def).
(label: pf.prop.fps.prodrule-fin-inf.Tm-def) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DecidableEq
Sort u → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: Propositional equality is `Decidable` for all elements of a type.

In other words, an instance of `DecidableEq α` is a means of deciding the proposition `a = b` is
for all `a b : α`.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries
Type u_1 → Type (max u_1 0)

Docstring: Formal power series over a coefficient type `R` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF OfNat.ofNat
{α : Type u} → (x : ℕ) → [self : OfNat α x] → α

Docstring: The `OfNat.ofNat` function is automatically inserted by the parser when
the user writes a numeric literal like `1 : α`. Implementations of this
typeclass can therefore customize the behavior of `n : α` based on `n` and
`α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instOfNatNat

## BASE-LIBRARY REF One.toOfNat1
{α : Type u_1} → [One α] → OfNat α 1

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MvPowerSeries.instOne
{σ : Type u_1} → {R : Type u_2} → [Semiring R] → One (MvPowerSeries σ R)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Unit
Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommSemiring.toSemiring
{R : Type u} → [self : CommSemiring R] → Semiring R

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toCommSemiring
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → CommSemiring α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF setOf
{α : Type u} → (α → Prop) → Set α

Docstring: Turn a predicate `p : α → Prop` into a set, also written as `{x | p x}` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF And
Prop → Prop → Prop

Docstring: `And a b`, or `a ∧ b`, is the conjunction of propositions. It can be
constructed and destructed like a pair: if `ha : a` and `hb : b` then
`⟨ha, hb⟩ : a ∧ b`, and if `h : a ∧ b` then `h.left : a` and `h.right : b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∧` in identifiers is `and`.

 * The recommended spelling of `/\` in identifiers is `and` (prefer `∧` over `/\`).

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Not
Prop → Prop

Docstring: `Not p`, or `¬p`, is the negation of `p`. It is defined to be `p → False`,
so if your goal is `¬p` you can use `intro h` to turn the goal into
`h : p ⊢ False`, and if you have `hn : ¬p` and `h : p` then `hn h : False`
and `(hn h).elim` will prove anything.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite.toFinset
{α : Type u} → {s : Set α} → s.Finite → Finset α

Docstring: Using choice, get the `Finset` that represents this `Set`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Ne
{α : Sort u} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: `a ≠ b`, or `Ne a b` is defined as `¬ (a = b)` or `a = b → False`,
and asserts that `a` and `b` are not equal.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `≠` in identifiers is `ne`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF DFunLike.coe
{F : Sort u_1} → {α : outParam (Sort u_2)} → {β : outParam (α → Sort u_3)} → [self : DFunLike F α β] → F → (a : α) → β a

Docstring: The coercion from `F` to a function. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF LinearMap

  {S : Type u_15} →
    [inst : Semiring R] →
      [inst_1 : Semiring S] →
        (R →+* S) →

            (M₂ : Type u_17) →
              [inst_2 : AddCommMonoid M] →
                [inst_3 : AddCommMonoid M₂] → [_root_.Module R M] → [_root_.Module S M₂] → Type (max u_16 u_17)

Docstring: A map `f` between an `R`-module and an `S`-module over a ring homomorphism `σ : R →+* S`
is semilinear if it satisfies the two properties `f (x + y) = f x + f y` and
`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which
`σ = RingHom.id R`), the notation `M →ₗ[R] M₂` is available. An unbundled version of plain linear
maps is available with the predicate `IsLinearMap`, but it should be avoided most of the time. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF RingHom.id

                  [inst_5 : _root_.Module S M₃] → {σ : R →+* S} → FunLike (M →ₛₗ[σ] M₃) M M₃

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PowerSeries.coeff
{R : Type u_1} → [inst : Semiring R] → ℕ → PowerSeries R →ₗ[R] R

Docstring: The `n`th coefficient of a formal power series. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.prod
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [CommMonoid M] → Finset ι → (ι → M) → M

Docstring: `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is the product of `f x` as `x` ranges over the elements of the finite set `s`.

When the index type is a `Fintype`, the notation `∏ x, f x`, is a shorthand for
`∏ x ∈ Finset.univ, f x`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing.toNonUnitalCommRing
{α : Type u} → [s : CommRing α] → NonUnitalCommRing α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.iUnion
{α : Type u} → {ι : Sort v} → (ι → Set α) → Set α

Docstring: Indexed union of a family of sets 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → {γ : outParam (Type w)} → [self : HAdd α β γ] → α → β → γ

Docstring: `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.
The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `+` in identifiers is `add`.

{α : Type u_1} → [Add α] → HAdd α α α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instAddNat
Add ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.instMembership
{α : Type u} → Membership α (Set α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.fst

Docstring: The first element of a pair. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero

Docstring: A type with a zero element. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.support

Docstring: `support` of a function is the set of points `x` such that `f x ≠ 0`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
lem.fps.infprod.claim7

\leanhelper  \textbf{(Claim 7.)} The family $(\prod _{i \in I_n} p_{i,k_i})$ indexed by essentially finite families $(k_i)$ supported on $I_n$ is summable: for each $n$, only finitely many such families yield $[x^n](\prod _{i \in I_n} p_{i,k_i}) \neq 0$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-conv.fps.exp.k-q-alg
conv.fps.exp.K-Q-alg

Throughout this section (unless otherwise stated), we assume that $K$ is not just a commutative ring, but actually a commutative $\mathbb {Q}$-algebra.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.commring
def.alg.commring

A \emph{commutative ring} means a set $K$ equipped with three maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \ominus &  :K\times K\rightarrow K,\\ \odot &  :K\times K\rightarrow K \end{align*}

 and two elements $\mathbf{0}\in K$ and $\mathbf{1}\in K$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in K$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Commutativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot b=b\odot a$ for all $a,b\in K$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of multiplication:} We have $a\odot \left( b\odot c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \odot c$ for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Distributivity:} We have

\[  a\odot \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\odot b\right) \oplus \left( a\odot c\right) \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \text{and}\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \left( a\oplus b\right) \odot c=\left( a\odot c\right) \oplus \left( b\odot c\right)  \]

 for all $a,b,c\in K$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of one:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}\odot a=a$ for all $a\in K$. 

\item \emph{Annihilation:} We have $a\odot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}\odot a=\mathbf{0}$ for all $a\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{multiplication} of the ring $K$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\odot b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The elements $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the \emph{zero} and the \emph{unity} (or the \emph{one}) of the ring $K$. We will simply call these elements $0$ and $1$ when confusion with the corresponding numbers is unlikely. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $. These imply that the operation $\odot $ has higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $, while the operations $\oplus $ and $\ominus $ are left-associative.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.kalg
def.alg.Kalg

A $K$\emph{-algebra} is a set $A$ equipped with four maps

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \ominus &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \odot &  :A\times A\rightarrow A,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times A\rightarrow A \end{align*}

 and two elements $\overrightarrow {0}\in A$ and $\overrightarrow {1}\in A$ satisfying the following properties: 

\begin{enumerate} \item The set $A$, equipped with the maps $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\odot $ and the two elements $\overrightarrow {0}$ and $\overrightarrow {1}$, is a (noncommutative) ring. 

\item The set $A$, equipped with the maps $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ and the element $\overrightarrow {0}$, is a $K$-module. 

\item We have

\begin{equation}  \lambda \rightharpoonup \left( a\odot b\right) =\left( \lambda \rightharpoonup a\right) \odot b=a\odot \left( \lambda \rightharpoonup b\right) \end{equation}

 for all $\lambda \in K$ and $a,b\in A$. 

\end{enumerate}

(Thus, in a nutshell, a $K$-algebra is a set $A$ that is simultaneously a ring and a $K$-module, with the property that the ring $A$ and the $K$-module $A$ have the same addition, the same subtraction and the same zero, and satisfy the additional compatibility property (\ref{eq.def.alg.Kalg.scaleinv}).)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.alg.module
def.alg.module

Let $K$ be a commutative ring. 

A $K$\emph{-module} means a set $M$ equipped with three maps 

\begin{align*}  \oplus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \ominus &  :M\times M\rightarrow M,\\ \rightharpoonup &  :K\times M\rightarrow M \end{align*}

 (notice that the third map has domain $K\times M$, not $M\times M$) and an element $\overrightarrow {0}\in M$ satisfying the following axioms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Commutativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus b=b\oplus a$ for all $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of addition:} We have $a\oplus \left( b\oplus c\right) =\left( a\oplus b\right) \oplus c$ for all $a,b,c\in M$. 

\item \emph{Neutrality of zero:} We have $a\oplus \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}\oplus a=a$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Subtraction undoes addition:} Let $a,b,c\in M$. We have $a\oplus b=c$ if and only if $a=c\ominus b$. 

\item \emph{Associativity of scaling:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) =\left( uv\right) \rightharpoonup a$ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Left distributivity:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \left( a\oplus b\right) =\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( u\rightharpoonup b\right) $ for all $u\in K$ and $a,b\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right distributivity:} We have $\left( u+v\right) \rightharpoonup a=\left( u\rightharpoonup a\right) \oplus \left( v\rightharpoonup a\right) $ for all $u,v\in K$ and $a\in M$.

\item \emph{Left annihilation:} We have $0\rightharpoonup a=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $a\in M$. 

\item \emph{Right annihilation:} We have $u\rightharpoonup \overrightarrow {0}=\overrightarrow {0}$ for all $u\in K$. 

\end{enumerate}

The operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ are called the \emph{addition}, the \emph{subtraction} and the \emph{scaling} (or the $K$\emph{-action}) of the $K$-module $M$. When confusion is unlikely, we will denote these three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $ by $+$, $-$ and $\cdot $, respectively, and we will abbreviate $a\rightharpoonup b=a\cdot b$ by $ab$. 

The element $\overrightarrow {0}$ is called the \emph{zero} (or the \emph{zero vector}) of the $K$-module $M$. We will usually just call it $0$. 

When $M$ is a $K$-module, the elements of $M$ are called \emph{vectors}, while the elements of $K$ are called \emph{scalars}. 

We will use \emph{PEMDAS conventions} for the three operations $\oplus $, $\ominus $ and $\rightharpoonup $, with the operation $\rightharpoonup $ having higher precedence than $\oplus $ and $\ominus $.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The blueprint states unconditionally that \u201cfor each n, only finitely many such families yield [x^n](\u220f_{i \u2208 I_n} p_{i,k_i}) \u2260 0.\u201d The Lean declaration instead requires the contentful premises `(\u2200 (i : I), p i 0 = 1)`, `(PowerSeries.CoeffSupportSetUnion p n).Finite`, `hIn_finite : (PowerSeries.IndexSetIn p n).Finite`, and `(PowerSeries.ValueSetKn p n).Finite` before asserting the relevant set is finite. None of these assumptions is present in the informal statement or fixed by its informal definitions. In particular, `p i 0 = 1` restricts the family, while finiteness of `CoeffSupportSetUnion`, `IndexSetIn`, and `ValueSetKn` supplies the key finiteness conditions rather than proving Claim 7 without qualification. The support predicate itself is faithful: `(\u2200 i \u2209 hIn_finite.toFinset, k i = 0)` expresses support on `I_n`, and the conclusion\u2019s set finiteness expresses coefficientwise summability. `[DecidableEq I]` is merely an encoding requirement for the finset representation, and using `[CommRing K]` rather than the section\u2019s commutative Q-algebra setting is a harmless strengthening by generality. To make the declaration faithful, remove the contentful premise binders and prove the finiteness conclusion from assumptions already included in a formally represented ambient context; alternatively, the blueprint statement would need to state those hypotheses explicitly."
