## TARGET PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{I : Type u_2} → (I → ℕ) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} f => EssentiallyFinite f

Docstring: A family `f : I → ℕ` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are 0.
This corresponds to `S^I_fin` in the source.

**This is an alias** for the canonical `_root_.EssentiallyFinite` defined in
`FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`. Both definitions are **definitionally equal**:
`{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` = `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.

For the full API (including `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.add`, `_root_.EssentiallyFinite.neg`,
`_root_.EssentiallyFinite.toFinsupp`, etc.), see `FPS/InfiniteProducts2.lean`.

This version is specialized to `ℕ` for use in product rule proofs. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY EssentiallyFinite (def)
{I : Type u_2} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (I → M) → Prop

Body:
fun {I} {M} [Zero M] f => (Function.support f).Finite

Docstring: A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Zero
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A type with a zero element. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Set.Finite
{α : Type u} → Set α → Prop

Docstring: A set is finite if the corresponding `Subtype` is finite,
i.e., if there exists a natural `n : ℕ` and an equivalence `s ≃ Fin n`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.support
{ι : Type u_1} → {M : Type u_3} → [Zero M] → (ι → M) → Set ι

Docstring: `support` of a function is the set of points `x` such that `f x ≠ 0`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.fps.infprod.essFinite

\leanhelper  A family $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ of natural numbers is \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many entries equal $0$, i.e., the set $\{ i \in I : k_i \neq 0\} $ is finite. This corresponds to $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ in the source.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.sfini
def.fps.infprod.SfinI

\leanhelper  The set $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ of \emph{essentially finite families} in $\prod _{i \in I} S_i$ is the set of all families $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ such that $k_i \in S_i$ for all $i$ and the family $(k_i)$ is essentially finite.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target has exactly the intended domain and condition: `{I : Type u_2} \u2192 (I \u2192 \u2115) \u2192 Prop`, matching \u201ca family `(k_i)_{i \u2208 I}` of natural numbers.\u201d Its body is the canonical `EssentiallyFinite f`, whose definition is `(Function.support f).Finite`. By the supplied base-library definition, `Function.support f` is `{i | f i \u2260 0}`, so the body states precisely that \u201cthe set `{ i \u2208 I : k_i \u2260 0 }` is finite,\u201d equivalently that all but finitely many entries are zero. There are no additional hypotheses or narrowed quantifiers."
