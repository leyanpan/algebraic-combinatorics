## TARGET fillingContent (def) — ELABORATED SIGNATURE
{N : ℕ} → [inst : NeZero N] → {lam mu : NPartition N} → SkewFilling lam mu → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] {lam mu} f i => {c | f c = i}.card

Docstring: The content of a filling: the number of cells with each entry value.
content(f)(i) = |{c ∈ Y(λ/μ) : f(c) = i}|

This is related to the monomial by: x_f = ∏_i x_i^{content(f)(i)}

The Bender-Knuth involution BK_k swaps the content of k and k+1:
content(BK_k(f))(k) = content(f)(k+1) and content(BK_k(f))(k+1) = content(f)(k) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition (inductive)
ℕ → Type

Body:
NPartition.mk : {N : ℕ} → (parts : Fin N → ℕ) → Antitone parts → NPartition N

Docstring: An N-partition is a weakly decreasing N-tuple of nonnegative integers.
(Definition def.sf.Npar)

This is represented as a function `Fin N → ℕ` that is antitone
(i.e., `i ≤ j → parts j ≤ parts i`).

The field is named `antitone` to match Mathlib conventions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY SkewFilling (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Type

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => { c // c ∈ skewYoungDiagram lam mu } → Fin N

Docstring: The type of all fillings of a skew diagram with entries in Fin N.
This is finite since the diagram is finite and Fin N is finite. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY skewYoungDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → [NeZero N] → NPartition N → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} [NeZero N] lam mu => lam.youngDiagram \ mu.youngDiagram

Docstring: The skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is the set difference Y(λ) \ Y(μ).
Definition \ref{def.sf.skew-diag} in the source.

**Note**: This is a duplicate of `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` that requires `[NeZero N]`.
Prefer `NPartition.skewYoungDiagram` for new code as it works for all `N`.

For N-partitions λ and μ with μ ⊆ λ, the skew Young diagram Y(λ/μ) is defined as:
```
Y(λ) \ Y(μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ [λ_i] \ [μ_i]}
            = {(i,j) | i ∈ [N] and j ∈ ℤ and μ_i < j ≤ λ_i}
```
(The second form uses 1-indexed j as in the textbook.)

In our 0-indexed formalization, this becomes:
```
Y(λ/μ) = {(i,j) | i ∈ Fin N and μ_i ≤ j < λ_i}
```

Example: Y((4,3,1)/(2,1,0)) consists of cells:
- Row 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)  (since μ₀ = 2, λ₀ = 4)
- Row 1: (1, 1), (1, 2)  (since μ₁ = 1, λ₁ = 3)
- Row 2: (2, 0)          (since μ₂ = 0, λ₂ = 1) 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.youngDiagram (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Finset (Fin N × ℕ)

Body:
fun {N} μ => Finset.univ.biUnion fun i => Finset.map { toFun := fun j => (i, j), inj' := ⋯ } (Finset.range (μ.parts i))

Docstring: The Young diagram Y(λ) of an N-partition λ is the set of cells (i, j) where
i ∈ Fin N and j < λ_i.
Definition def.sf.ydiag in the source.

Note: Mathlib has `YoungDiagram` which is more general (infinite diagrams).
Here we define a version specific to N-partitions. 

## PROJECT DEPENDENCY NPartition.parts (def)
{N : ℕ} → NPartition N → Fin N → ℕ

Body:
fun N self => self.1

Docstring: The entries of the N-partition as a function from `Fin N` to `ℕ` 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat
Type

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF NeZero
{R : Type u_1} → [Zero R] → R → Prop

Docstring: A type-class version of `n ≠ 0`.  

## BASE-LIBRARY REF MulZeroClass.toZero
{M₀ : Type u} → [self : MulZeroClass M₀] → Zero M₀

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instMulZeroClass
MulZeroClass ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin
ℕ → Type

Docstring: Natural numbers less than some upper bound.

In particular, a `Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `i < n`. It is the
canonical type with `n` elements.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.card
{α : Type u_1} → Finset α → ℕ

Docstring: `s.card` is the number of elements of `s`, aka its cardinality.

The notation `#s` can be accessed in the `Finset` locale. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Subtype
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Sort (max 1 u)

Docstring: All the elements of a type that satisfy a predicate.

`Subtype p`, usually written `{ x : α // p x }` or `{ x // p x }`, contains all elements `x : α` for
which `p x` is true. Its constructor is a pair of the value and the proof that it satisfies the
predicate. In run-time code, `{ x : α // p x }` is represented identically to `α`.

There is a coercion from `{ x : α // p x }` to `α`, so elements of a subtype may be used where the
underlying type is expected.

Examples:
 * `{ n : Nat // n % 2 = 0 }` is the type of even numbers.
 * `{ xs : Array String // xs.size = 5 }` is the type of arrays with five `String`s.
 * Given `xs : List α`, `List { x : α // x ∈ xs }` is the type of lists in which all elements are
   contained in `xs`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `{ x // p x }` in identifiers is `subtype`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod
Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)

Docstring: The product type, usually written `α × β`. Product types are also called pair or tuple types.
Elements of this type are pairs in which the first element is an `α` and the second element is a
`β`.

Products nest to the right, so `(x, y, z) : α × β × γ` is equivalent to `(x, (y, z)) : α × (β × γ)`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `×` in identifiers is `Prod`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Membership.mem
{α : outParam (Type u)} → {γ : Type v} → [self : Membership α γ] → γ → α → Prop

Docstring: The membership relation `a ∈ s : Prop` where `a : α`, `s : γ`. 

Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `∈` in identifiers is `mem`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset
Type u_4 → Type u_4

Docstring: `Finset α` is the type of finite sets of elements of `α`. It is implemented
as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instMembership
{α : Type u_1} → Membership α (Finset α)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.filter
{α : Type u_1} → (p : α → Prop) → [DecidablePred p] → Finset α → Finset α

Docstring: `Finset.filter p s` is the set of elements of `s` that satisfy `p`.

For example, one can use `s.filter (· ∈ t)` to get the intersection of `s` with `t : Set α`
as a `Finset α` (when a `DecidablePred (· ∈ t)` instance is available). 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqFin
(n : ℕ) → DecidableEq (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.univ
{α : Type u_1} → [Fintype α] → Finset α

Docstring: `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
the assumption `Fintype α`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.Subtype.fintype
{α : Type u_1} → (s : Finset α) → Fintype { x // x ∈ s }

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Antitone
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → [Preorder α] → [Preorder β] → (α → β) → Prop

Docstring: A function `f` is antitone if `a ≤ b` implies `f b ≤ f a`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF PartialOrder.toPreorder
{α : Type u_2} → [self : PartialOrder α] → Preorder α

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.instPartialOrder
{n : ℕ} → PartialOrder (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Nat.instPreorder
Preorder ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF SDiff.sdiff
{α : Type u} → [self : SDiff α] → α → α → α

Docstring: `a \ b` is the set difference of `a` and `b`,
consisting of all elements in `a` that are not in `b`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `\` in identifiers is `sdiff`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.instSDiff
{α : Type u_1} → [DecidableEq α] → SDiff (Finset α)

Docstring: `s \ t` is the set consisting of the elements of `s` that are not in `t`. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqProd
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq α] → [DecidableEq β] → DecidableEq (α × β)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF instDecidableEqNat
DecidableEq ℕ

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.biUnion
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → [DecidableEq β] → Finset α → (α → Finset β) → Finset β

Docstring: `Finset.biUnion s t` is the union of `t a` over `a ∈ s`.

(This was formerly `bind` due to the monad structure on types with `DecidableEq`.) 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Fin.fintype
(n : ℕ) → Fintype (Fin n)

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.map
{α : Type u_1} → {β : Type u_2} → (α ↪ β) → Finset α → Finset β

Docstring: When `f` is an embedding of `α` in `β` and `s` is a finset in `α`, then `s.map f` is the image
finset in `β`. The embedding condition guarantees that there are no duplicates in the image. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Function.Embedding.mk
{α : Sort u_1} → {β : Sort u_2} → (toFun : α → β) → Function.Injective toFun → α ↪ β

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Prod.mk
{α : Type u} → {β : Type v} → α → β → α × β

Docstring: Constructs a pair. This is usually written `(x, y)` instead of `Prod.mk x y`.


Conventions for notations in identifiers:

 * The recommended spelling of `(a, b)` in identifiers is `mk`.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Finset.range
ℕ → Finset ℕ

Docstring: `range n` is the set of natural numbers less than `n`. 

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
def.sf.filling-content

\leanhelper  The \emph{content} of a filling $f$ of $Y(\lambda /\mu )$ is the function $\mathrm{cont}(f) : [N] \to \mathbb {N}$ defined by 

\[  \mathrm{cont}(f)(i) = \# \{ c \in Y(\lambda /\mu ) : f(c) = i\} .  \]

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "drift",
  "justification": "The body correctly computes the stated cardinality: `fun ... f i => {c | f c = i}.card` matches `cont(f)(i) = # { c \u2208 Y(\u03bb/\u03bc) : f(c) = i }`, since `f : SkewFilling lam mu` has domain the subtype of cells in `skewYoungDiagram lam mu`. However, the elaborated signature adds `{N : \u2115} \u2192 [inst : NeZero N] \u2192`, while the blueprint defines the content for `[N]` without requiring `N \u2260 0`. This excludes the mathematically meaningful `N = 0` case and is therefore a narrowed quantifier. The restriction enters through `SkewFilling`, whose signature itself requires `[NeZero N]`, and through its use of the duplicate `skewYoungDiagram` carrying the same binder. To make the declaration faithful, generalize `SkewFilling` to all `N` using a skew-diagram definition without `[NeZero N]`, then remove `[NeZero N]` from `fillingContent`."
