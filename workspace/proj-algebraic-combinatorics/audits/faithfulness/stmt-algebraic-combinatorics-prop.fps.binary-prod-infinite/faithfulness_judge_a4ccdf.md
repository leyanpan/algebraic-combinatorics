Docstring: The infinite product `∏_{i ∈ ℕ} (1 + x^{2^i})` equals `1/(1-x)`.
This relates to the unique binary representation of natural numbers:
each natural number can be written uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

## BASE-LIBRARY REF CommRing
Type u → Type u

Docstring: A commutative ring is a ring with commutative multiplication. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Eq
{α : Sort u_1} → α → α → Prop

Docstring: The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.

Docstring: The natural numbers, starting at zero.

This type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler, and overridden with an efficient
implementation. Both use a fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic library (usually
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/)); at runtime, `Nat` values that are sufficiently small are unboxed.


## BASE-LIBRARY REF HAdd.hAdd

Type

Docstring: The canonical type with one element. This element is written `()`.

`Unit` has a number of uses:
* It can be used to model control flow that returns from a function call without providing other
  information.
* Monadic actions that return `Unit` have side effects without computing values.
* In polymorphic types, it can be used to indicate that no data is to be stored in a particular
  field.

`f (c • x) = (σ c) • f x`. Elements of `LinearMap σ M M₂` (available under the notation
`M →ₛₗ[σ] M₂`) are bundled versions of such maps. For plain linear maps (i.e. for which

as a multiset (a list up to permutation) which has no duplicate elements. 

## BASE-LIBRARY REF Exists
{α : Sort u} → (α → Prop) → Prop

Docstring: Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```

## INFORMAL STATEMENT
prop.fps.binary-prod-infinite

\leanhelper  We have 

\[  \prod _{i=0}^{\infty }\left(1+x^{2^{i}}\right) = \frac{1}{1-x}.  \]

 This relates to the unique binary representation of natural numbers.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.coeff
def.fps.coeff

If $n\in \mathbb {N}$, and if $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) \in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ is an FPS, then we define an element $\left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}\in K$ by 

\[  \left[x^{n}\right]\mathbf{a}:=a_{n}.  \]

 This is called the \emph{coefficient of }$x^{n}$\emph{ in }$\mathbf{a}$, or the $n$\emph{-th coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$, or the $x^{n}$\emph{-coefficient} of $\mathbf{a}$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.fps
def.fps.fps

A \emph{formal power series} (or, short, \emph{FPS}) in $1$ indeterminate over $K$ means a sequence $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right) = \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\in \mathbb {N}} \in K^{\mathbb {N}}$ of elements of $K$.

def.fps.infprod.essFinite

\leanhelper  A family $(k_i)_{i \in I}$ of natural numbers is \emph{essentially finite} if all but finitely many entries equal $0$, i.e., the set $\{ i \in I : k_i \neq 0\} $ is finite. This corresponds to $S^I_{\mathrm{fin}}$ in the source.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.infprod.sfini

\[  n=\sum _{i\in \mathbb {N}}b_{i}2^{i}.  \]

 (Recall that “essentially finite” means “all but finitely many $i\in \mathbb {N}$ satisfy $b_{i}=0$”.)

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.lim.ismultipliable
def.fps.lim.isMultipliable

\leanhelper  A family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ of FPSs is \emph{multipliable} if (1) $[x^0]f_i = 1$ for all $i$, and (2) for each $n \in \mathbb {N}$, there exists $N$ such that for all $i \geq N$ and all $k \leq n$, $[x^k]f_i = \delta _{k,0}$ (i.e., eventually all $f_i$ are $\equiv 1 \pmod{x^{n+1}}$).

\leanhelper  The \emph{infinite product} of a multipliable family $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb {N}}$ is the FPS $\prod _{n \in \mathbb {N}} f_n$ whose $n$-th coefficient equals $[x^n](\prod _{j=0}^{N} f_j)$ for any sufficiently large $N$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.ops
def.fps.ops

\textbf{(a)} The \emph{sum} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}+b_{0},\  \  a_{1}+b_{1},\  \  a_{2}+b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(b)} The \emph{difference} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS

\[  \left(a_{0}-b_{0},\  \  a_{1}-b_{1},\  \  a_{2}-b_{2},\  \  \ldots \right).  \]

 It is denoted by $\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(c)} If $\lambda \in K$ and if $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ is an FPS, then we define an FPS 

\[  \lambda \mathbf{a}:=\left(\lambda a_{0},\lambda a_{1},\lambda a_{2},\ldots \right).  \]

\textbf{(d)} The \emph{product} of two FPSs $\mathbf{a}=\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\ldots \right)$ is defined to be the FPS $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},\ldots \right)$, where 

\begin{align*}  c_{n} &  =\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{n-i}=\sum _{\substack {\left(i,j\right) \in \mathbb {N}^{2};\\ \begin{bgroup} i+j=n

 This product is denoted by $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ or just by $\mathbf{ab}$. \medskip 

\textbf{(e)} For each $a\in K$, we define $\underline{a}$ to be the FPS $\left(a,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. An FPS of the form $\underline{a}$ for some $a\in K$ (that is, an FPS $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots \right)$ satisfying $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=\cdots =0$) is said to be \emph{constant}. \medskip 

\textbf{(f)} The set of all FPSs (in $1$ indeterminate over $K$) is denoted $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.x
def.fps.x

Let $x$ denote the FPS $\left(0,1,0,0,0,\ldots \right)$. In other words, let $x$ denote the FPS with $\left[x^{1}\right]x=1$ and $\left[x^{i}\right]x=0$ for all $i\neq 1$.

## INFORMAL DEFINITION stmt-algebraic-combinatorics-def.fps.xneq
def.fps.xneq

Let $n\in \mathbb {N}$. Let $f,g\in K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ be two FPSs. We write $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$ if and only if 

\[  \text{each }m\in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots ,n\right\} \text{ satisfies } \left[x^{m}\right]f=\left[x^{m}\right]g.  \]

Thus, we have defined a binary relation $\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }$ on the set $K\left[\left[x\right]\right]$. We say that an FPS $f$ is $x^{n}$\emph{-equivalent} to an FPS $g$ if and only if $f\overset {x^{n}}{\equiv }g$.

## VERDICT
{
  "verdict": "faithful",
  "justification": "The target states, for every `{R : Type u_1} [CommRing R]`, exactly `PowerSeries.tprod (fun i => 1 + PowerSeries.X ^ 2 ^ i) \u22ef = (1 - PowerSeries.X).invOfUnit 1`, matching `\u220f_{i=0}^{\u221e}(1+x^{2^i}) = 1/(1-x)`. The omitted argument is supplied by `PowerSeries.multipliable_one_add_pow_two`, so it adds no hypothesis. Although the blueprint describes the geometric series over a field, the Lean theorem is more general over any commutative ring; this is a weaker hypothesis and hence a faithful strengthening. The project\u2019s `tprod` uses stabilized coefficients over finite supersets rather than explicitly initial segments, but for the index type `\u2115`, every finite determining set lies in a sufficiently large initial segment, so it gives the blueprint\u2019s infinite-product coefficients. Finally, `invOfUnit 1` applied to `1 - X` represents its formal-power-series inverse using its unit constant coefficient `1`."
